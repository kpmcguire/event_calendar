The mezzotint technique has remained unchanged for 300 years. Its characteristic rich black tone is achieved by roughening the metal plate with a rocker.&nbsp;Cleo&rsquo;s haunting prints, many of which are very small, beckon the viewer to come closer and to truly engage with each piece.&nbsp; Made possible in part with funds from the New York State Council on the Arts, administered by the Community Arts Partnership.</p>
