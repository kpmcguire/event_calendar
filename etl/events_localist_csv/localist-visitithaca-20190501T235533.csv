,1605733, World Picture: Travel Imagery Before and After Photography ,https://events.visitithaca.com/event/world_picture_travel_imagery_before_and_after_photography,2019-05-01T09:00:00-04:00,"","<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><span>Drawing from Cornell&rsquo;s Rare and Manuscript Collections and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

The mezzotint technique has remained unchanged for 300 years. Its characteristic rich black tone is achieved by roughening the metal plate with a rocker.&nbsp;Cleo&rsquo;s haunting prints, many of which are very small, beckon the viewer to come closer and to truly engage with each piece.&nbsp; Made possible in part with funds from the New York State Council on the Arts, administered by the Community Arts Partnership.</p>
