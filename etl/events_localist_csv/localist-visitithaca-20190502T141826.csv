<p>Featuring&nbsp;<a href=""https://littlewhaleproductions.com/about"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Chris Holmes</a>&nbsp;the only person who can streak standing still. Don&rsquo;t worry, this is a clothes on show. However, we have agreed that body paint is technically clothing.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.michellecourtneyberry.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Courtney Berry</a>&nbsp;Berry is an author, speaker, trainer, coach, actor, performing artist, poet, nature lover, and now comedian who helps improve the quality of people&rsquo;s lives by helping them manage stress, time, conflict, and competing priorities.</p>

<p>Michael Roberts&nbsp;is a storyteller and a &quot;Trampoline&quot; favorite. His stories are always hilarious. Sometimes, I wonder if he puts himself in those situations just his stories will always be better than yours.</p>

<p>Brandon Fortunberry,&nbsp;only comes out once a year to do comedy, but when he comes it is waaaaaaaaay better than a Cranberry Almond Endive Cup</p>

<p>Closing out the show is comedian&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Crangelia/"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Angalia Petrillo</a>,&nbsp;from Scranton PA. Angalia, has been making a name for herself performing throughout PA, Upstate and Central NY.

<p>You will be able to learn doming if you want to incorporate that and various oxidation or patinas.</p>

<p>We will begin with discussing design options, looking at images for ideas, and going over the tools we will be using. Your designs can be as simple or intricate as you would like. There will be cabochon stones to set (or bring your own) and we will work with brass, copper, and aluminum.</p>

<p>Sterling silver will be available to purchase separately. All other materials are included in the class price. Cold connections lets you get very creative with your designs and it is an easier technique to use when not in a fully equipped studio (like if you are at home) or on the go.</p>

With Deng Chao, Sun Li, Zheng Kai, Wang Qianyuan

In a kingdom ruled by a young and unpredictable king, the military commander has a secret weapon: a “shadow,” a look-alike who can fool both his enemies and the King himself.  Now he must use this weapon in an intricate plan that will lead his people to victory in a war that the King does not want. Based on the fabled “Three Kingdoms” saga of Chinese legend… Shadow is a knotty tale of palace intrigue, old grudges and crafty doppelgangers. Director Zhang Yimou (Hero, House of Flying Daggers) once again pushes the boundaries of wuxia action to create a film like no other, masterfully painting a canvas of inky blacks and greys punctuated with bursts of color from the blood of the defeated. “Shadow [is] a thrilling return to form, which matches Zhang’s best work for the sheer voracious elegance of the images and possibly surpasses much of it for inventiveness.” (Variety) In Mandarin. Subtitled. More at wellgousa.com/films/shadow

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

With Deng Chao, Sun Li, Zheng Kai, Wang Qianyuan

In a kingdom ruled by a young and unpredictable king, the military commander has a secret weapon: a “shadow,” a look-alike who can fool both his enemies and the King himself.  Now he must use this weapon in an intricate plan that will lead his people to victory in a war that the King does not want. Based on the fabled “Three Kingdoms” saga of Chinese legend… Shadow is a knotty tale of palace intrigue, old grudges and crafty doppelgangers. Director Zhang Yimou (Hero, House of Flying Daggers) once again pushes the boundaries of wuxia action to create a film like no other, masterfully painting a canvas of inky blacks and greys punctuated with bursts of color from the blood of the defeated. “Shadow [is] a thrilling return to form, which matches Zhang’s best work for the sheer voracious elegance of the images and possibly surpasses much of it for inventiveness.” (Variety) In Mandarin. Subtitled. More at wellgousa.com/films/shadow

<br />
6-6:45 PM: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/noonfifteen/"" target=""_blank"">Noon Fifteen</a><br />
7-8 PM: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/kitestringband/"" target=""_blank"">Kitestring</a><br />
<br />
Progressive soul band <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/noonfifteen/"" target=""_blank"">Noon Fifteen</a> blends rich vocal harmonies, vintage keyboard and guitar tones, and funky bass and drum grooves into catchy, original songs that are full of surprises. The five-piece is influenced by 1960s California and Liverpool, 1970s Memphis and New Orleans, and the DIY ethos of the internet-powered independent music scene.<br />
<br />
Fronted by dynamic vocalist Mandy Goldman and rounded out by versatile singer/instrumentalists Samuel B. Lupowitz, Harry Nichols, Joe Massa, and Phil Shay, Noon Fifteen entertains with witty, earnest lyrics and a Stax Revue&rsquo;s heart and soul.<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/kitestringband/"" target=""_blank"">Kitestring</a> is a four-piece alternative rock band featuring all-original music that ranges from indie rock to rootsy Americana and soul.<br />
<br />
The band centers around the unique talent of singer-songwriter Josh Ross. Ross, whose soulful vocal performance makes it impossible not to feel something, is supported by bassist Jeremy Betterley, guitarist Marty Farchione, and drummer Phil Shay.<br />
<br />
Their song styles cover an eclectic range with the unifying thread of memorable melodies, solid musicianship. Kitestring&rsquo;s sound is stripped down to the elements necessary to convey the message of their songs.<br />
<br />
Kitestring last took the stage at the CFCU Summer Concert Series in 2017, where they won the finale of the Battle of the Bands.<br />
Their concert this year will also be their new album release party, your first opportunity to take their new music home with you.<br />
<br />
All concerts in this series are free, all ages, and family friendly. Concerts take place on the Bernie Milton Pavilion on the Commons. In case of severe weather, shows may move inside to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Therangeithaca/"" target=""_blank"">The Range</a>.<br />

Her songs are an illustration of the pendulum that swings between joy and heartache.<br />
<br />
Her first album, &ldquo;A Good Woman is Hard to Find&rdquo; has garnered her praise from country/folk fans and connoisseurs alike.<br />
Janet&#39;s musical style has been referred to as &quot;country with an art degree&quot; and she has been endeared as &quot;the voice of the hills&quot;.<br />

<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/roseandthebros/"" target=""_blank"">Rose &amp; The Bros</a> are a powerhouse ensemble specializing in irresistible Zydeco and Cajun dance grooves resonating with sweet vocal harmonies and crooning country roots.<br />
<br />
With a shared dream to simply have a blast while making people dance without stopping, Rosie Newton, Paul Martin, and Steve Selin set out to collect tunes and the rare ingredients of a no holds barred Zydeco and Cajun dance party. Once the trio had found their undeniable rhythm section in drummer Greg Evans, bassist Angelo Peters, and rub board/triangle player Sally Freund, Rose &amp; The Bros became a six piece instant party and the band was complete. Now, Rose &amp; The Bros inspire a warm following with infectious joy, a love for community, and a rollicking good time.<br />

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

He was lead guitarist with Genesis as part of their classic line up with Gabriel, Collins, Banks and Rutherford, that produced acclaimed albums such as Selling England by the Pound (a favourite of John Lennon). With Steve&#39;s extraordinary versatility in both his electric guitar playing and his composing, he involves influences from many genres, including Jazz, World Music and Blues. He is equally adept in his classical albums that include renditions of pieces by composers from Bach to Satie, his own acoustic guitar compositions that have gained the admiration of many, including Yehudi Menuhin, and ambitious guitar/ orchestra albums such as A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic.<br />
With Genesis, Steve&#39;s guitar playing produced some of the most memorable moments, from the sensitivity of his acoustic sound on Horizons and Blood on the Rooftops the dramatic rock guitar solos of Firth of Fifth and Fountain of Salmacis.</p>

<p>The Capitol Steps were born in December, 1981 when some staffers for Senator Charles Percy were planning entertainment for a Christmas party. Ronald Reagan was President when the Steps began, so co-founders Elaina Newport, Bill Strauss and Jim Aidala figured that if entertainers could become politicians, then politicians could become entertainers! Their first idea was to stage a nativity play, but in the whole Congress they couldn&#39;t find three wise men or a virgin! So, they decided to dig into the headlines of the day, and created song parodies &amp; skits which conveyed a special brand of satirical humor that was as popular in Peoria as it was on Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>

<p>Jenny Lewis has confirmed her highly anticipated return with her fourth solo album - On The Line - out spring 2019 on Warner Bros. Records. Since releasing 2014&rsquo;s critically acclaimed The Voyager&mdash; which NPR likened to &ldquo;California sunshine glinting off the Pacific Ocean, steeped in the West Coast pop sounds of the 1970s&rdquo;&mdash; Jenny Lewis has been plotting her highly anticipated return. Between headlining dates around the globe and stealing the show at Newport Folk Festival 2018, not to mention captivating audiences as special guest of Beck at Madison Square Garden, Jenny has been fastidious in recording brand new material. Featuring a who&rsquo;s who of supporting players including Beck, Benmont Tench, Don Was, Jim Keltner and Ringo Starr among others, and recorded at the distinguished Capitol Studios, On The Line will no doubt be a triumphant and irresistible highlight of 2019.&nbsp;</p>
