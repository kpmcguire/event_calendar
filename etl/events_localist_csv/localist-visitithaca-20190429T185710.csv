Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

With Deng Chao, Sun Li, Zheng Kai, Wang Qianyuan

In a kingdom ruled by a young and unpredictable king, the military commander has a secret weapon: a “shadow,” a look-alike who can fool both his enemies and the King himself.  Now he must use this weapon in an intricate plan that will lead his people to victory in a war that the King does not want. Based on the fabled “Three Kingdoms” saga of Chinese legend… Shadow is a knotty tale of palace intrigue, old grudges and crafty doppelgangers. Director Zhang Yimou (Hero, House of Flying Daggers) once again pushes the boundaries of wuxia action to create a film like no other, masterfully painting a canvas of inky blacks and greys punctuated with bursts of color from the blood of the defeated. “Shadow [is] a thrilling return to form, which matches Zhang’s best work for the sheer voracious elegance of the images and possibly surpasses much of it for inventiveness.” (Variety) In Mandarin. Subtitled. More at wellgousa.com/films/shadow

With Deng Chao, Sun Li, Zheng Kai, Wang Qianyuan

In a kingdom ruled by a young and unpredictable king, the military commander has a secret weapon: a “shadow,” a look-alike who can fool both his enemies and the King himself.  Now he must use this weapon in an intricate plan that will lead his people to victory in a war that the King does not want. Based on the fabled “Three Kingdoms” saga of Chinese legend… Shadow is a knotty tale of palace intrigue, old grudges and crafty doppelgangers. Director Zhang Yimou (Hero, House of Flying Daggers) once again pushes the boundaries of wuxia action to create a film like no other, masterfully painting a canvas of inky blacks and greys punctuated with bursts of color from the blood of the defeated. “Shadow [is] a thrilling return to form, which matches Zhang’s best work for the sheer voracious elegance of the images and possibly surpasses much of it for inventiveness.” (Variety) In Mandarin.

,1637147,"May 12, 2019: Shadow at Willard Straight Theatre",https://events.visitithaca.com/event/may_12_2019_shadow_at_willard_straight_theatre,2019-05-12T19:30:00-04:00,,"2019 > China > Directed by Zhang Yimou

With Deng Chao, Sun Li, Zheng Kai, Wang Qianyuan

In a kingdom ruled by a young and unpredictable king, the military commander has a secret weapon: a “shadow,” a look-alike who can fool both his enemies and the King himself.  Now he must use this weapon in an intricate plan that will lead his people to victory in a war that the King does not want. Based on the fabled “Three Kingdoms” saga of Chinese legend… Shadow is a knotty tale of palace intrigue, old grudges and crafty doppelgangers. Director Zhang Yimou (Hero, House of Flying Daggers) once again pushes the boundaries of wuxia action to create a film like no other, masterfully painting a canvas of inky blacks and greys punctuated with bursts of color from the blood of the defeated. “Shadow [is] a thrilling return to form, which matches Zhang’s best work for the sheer voracious elegance of the images and possibly surpasses much of it for inventiveness.” (Variety) In Mandarin. Subtitled. More at wellgousa.com/films/shadow

<p>Alejandro Rose-Garcia (aka Shakey Graves) announced his newest album &#39;Can&#39;t Wake Up&#39; (out now on Dualtone) with a simple message to his fans - &ldquo;Next album. New sound. Sell your suspenders.&quot; That tongue-in-cheek statement, though, was a genuine attempt to prepare his followers for a major sonic shift for the Texas songwriter, who got his start performing as a one-man band, culminating with an Americana Music Awards win for &quot;Emerging Artist of the Year&quot; behind his breakout full-length album, &#39;And The War Came.&#39; Now armed with a full band, Rose-Garcia leaves behind much of that stripped-down, folk-y sound. &#39;Can&#39;t Wake Up&#39; takes his songwriting in a &quot;decidedly bigger direction&quot; full of &quot;lush indie compositions&quot; (Consequence of Sound), drawing on another set of his musical influences, ranging from the Beatles and Harry Nilsson to Elliott Smith, Broken Social Scene, Built to Spill and other &#39;90s indie rock bands.</p>

He was lead guitarist with Genesis as part of their classic line up with Gabriel, Collins, Banks and Rutherford, that produced acclaimed albums such as Selling England by the Pound (a favourite of John Lennon). With Steve&#39;s extraordinary versatility in both his electric guitar playing and his composing, he involves influences from many genres, including Jazz, World Music and Blues. He is equally adept in his classical albums that include renditions of pieces by composers from Bach to Satie, his own acoustic guitar compositions that have gained the admiration of many, including Yehudi Menuhin, and ambitious guitar/ orchestra albums such as A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, recorded with the Royal Philharmonic.<br />
With Genesis, Steve&#39;s guitar playing produced some of the most memorable moments, from the sensitivity of his acoustic sound on Horizons and Blood on the Rooftops the dramatic rock guitar solos of Firth of Fifth and Fountain of Salmacis.</p>

<p>The Capitol Steps were born in December, 1981 when some staffers for Senator Charles Percy were planning entertainment for a Christmas party. Ronald Reagan was President when the Steps began, so co-founders Elaina Newport, Bill Strauss and Jim Aidala figured that if entertainers could become politicians, then politicians could become entertainers! Their first idea was to stage a nativity play, but in the whole Congress they couldn&#39;t find three wise men or a virgin! So, they decided to dig into the headlines of the day, and created song parodies &amp; skits which conveyed a special brand of satirical humor that was as popular in Peoria as it was on Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>

Since releasing 2014&rsquo;s critically acclaimed The Voyager&mdash; which NPR likened to &ldquo;California sunshine glinting off the Pacific Ocean, steeped in the West Coast pop sounds of the 1970s&rdquo;&mdash; Jenny Lewis has been plotting her highly anticipated return. Between headlining dates around the globe and stealing the show at Newport Folk Festival 2018, not to mention captivating audiences as special guest of Beck at Madison Square Garden, Jenny has been fastidious in recording brand new material. Featuring a who&rsquo;s who of supporting players including Beck, Benmont Tench, Don Was, Jim Keltner and Ringo Starr among others, and recorded at the distinguished Capitol Studios, On The Line will no doubt be a triumphant and irresistible highlight of 2019.&nbsp;</p>
