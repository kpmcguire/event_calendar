Seven species displayed represent a small percentage of plants that are either extirpated (SX) or considered endangered historical species (SH), not having been recorded in 20-30 years. Each piece was researched and based on a particular specimen within the collections of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Herbarium at Cornell, or the C. V. Starr Virtual Herbarium. These embossings serve as a personal homage to the absence of an increasing number of this region&#39;s flora from their botanic communities.</p>

Thursday, May 2, 2019


4:30pm to 6:00pm


Cornell Cooperative Extension of Wyoming County


36 Center Street, Warsaw, NY 14569


Cost is $10 per person or $5 per person for CCE Ag Dept Enrollees


Come learn how high tunnels work to grow crops throughout the year. This session will focus on crops grown in the tunnels during the colder months and timing your transition to warm weather plantings like peppers, tomato, and cucumbers. Whether you are looking to get an early start in the spring, grow later into the fall, or even keep cold hardy plants alive throughout the winter, this session will have information you need. Demonstration will include a comparison of size and quality, of late fall planted/over wintered greens, spinach and lettuce, to early spring plantings. We will gather indoors and then take a short walk out to the on-site high tunnel. The session will be primarily outdoors in the high tunnel, so please dress for the weather. If you arrive late and would like to catch up with the group, the high tunnel is south of the building perpendicular to the large white barn.


Discussion Topics to Include:


 High Tunnel Basics, Site Selection, and Orientation


 Timing Cool Weather Plantings


 Temperature Control within High Tunnels


 Transitioning from Cold Weather Crops to Warm Weather Crops


 Irrigation of Cold Weather Crops vs. Warm Weather Crops


 Fertilization


 Common Pests and Disease


 Use of Row Cover for Overwintering Crops

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

The method characterizes linear dynamics around a steady state when that steady state differs from any individual agent&#39;s long run expectation. It applies when agents agree to disagree, as well as when they differ in aversion to Knightian uncertainty and hence behave as if they hold different worst case beliefs. It thus provides a simple way to study effects of uncertainty on behavior in linear models. Our leading example looks at precautionary savings, asset premia and gains from insurance in a borrower-lender model with agents </span></span>who differ in uncertainty aversion.</span></span></span></p>

at the School of Humanities at Tallinn University. His teaching include Current<br />

Politics and Society courses and PhD courses in Cultural Studies.</p>

<p>Crisis, warring, and never-ending suffering propel humanitarian organizations to<br />
the forefront of media attention. Examining the use of t&eacute;moignage (witnessing)<br />
in the work of MSF, Peter Redfield notes that big NGOs now play a central role in<br />
defining secular moral truth for an international audience (Redfield 2006: 5&ndash;6).<br />
Combining medical expression, expert knowledge, public expression, and in the<br />
case of the Free Burma Rangers, mission, health organizations are able to<br />
mobilize both the most vulnerable people as well as substantial financial and<br />
moral support from a great field of followers (Redfield 2013). Moreover, the Free<br />
Burma Rangers also involve Rangers and ethnic minority villagers in witnessing<br />
and fact finding, by training them for independent human rights documentation,<br />
which will then feed the news of their website.</p>

<p>In the following, I look into emergency healthcare for the wounded in the<br />
border zones of Myanmar&rsquo;s ethnic minorities through the example of the Free<br />
Burma Rangers. First, as a missionary and armed (for self-defence) humanitarian<br />
organization engaged in healthcare and nursing, the FBR represent an<br />
expression of the failure of international organizations and governments in<br />
protecting the most needy villagers. Secondly, I am interested in the mandate of<br />
the FBR, who operate secretif and outside of the existing Border Consortium. The<br />
example of the FBR sheds light on global networks of humanitarian<br />
organizations and their being embedded into political alliances of conservative<br />
Christians in the USA, politicians, and the US army. Finally, the example shows<br />
the important role of international NGOs and their alliances with locals in the<br />
politics of protection. Situating the FBR in a larger empirical context, I ask: how<br />
do these humanitarian health organizations shape new landscapes of<br />
humanitarian assistance and mobilization? How are the most vulnerable<br />
refugees situated in this growing field of voluntary intervention and<br />
mobilization? How does the insertion into these new assemblages situate the<br />
individual self within Christian infrastructures of humanitarian aid? Given the<br />
human rights documentation of the FBR and their accumulation of knowledge<br />
about the Karen etc. where is the place of anthropology and anthropological<br />
knowledge about the figure of the displaced migrant-refugee? Not least: What is<br />
my ethical role as an anthropologist doing fieldwork with vulnerable people?</p>

My lab examines psychological barriers to&nbsp;addressing climate change&mdash;and what those barriers tell us about how the social mind works. We suggest that&nbsp;Democrats and Republicans disagree about climate policy largely for the sake of disagreement. Democrats and&nbsp;Republicans support climate policies more when those policies are backed by politicians from their own party than&nbsp;when backed by politicians from the other party. Citizens are swayed by politicians because they expect their&nbsp;partisan peers to toe the party line&mdash;and people are loath to disagree with partisan peers. Although daunting, an&nbsp;appreciation of psychological barriers suggests strategies to overcome them. For example, learning that other&nbsp;members of one&rsquo;s political group support climate policy substantially increases one&rsquo;s own support for climate&nbsp;policy. And structured reflection on personal beliefs about good citizenship reduces political polarization over&nbsp;climate policy. These findings can inform grassroots efforts to more effectively lobby for climate policy. They also&nbsp;illustrate how psychological scientists can help address climate change.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></i></p>

The area planted with soybeans in the Amazon biome of Brazil was about 4.5 million hectares in 2018, and together with the area planted with corn in the region there are nearly 8 million hectares of these crops, the majority of which are managed using no-till techniques. Across a large portion of this area the use of cover crops is either nonexistent or incipient, and their use in agricultural systems is not based on research but is instead empirical and consists of just a few species. Due to factors such as low soil fertility, high rainfall rates, and a strong dry season coupled with more frequent and severe droughts, the incorporation of a cover crop into soybean and corn rotations is a logical next step towards increased sustainability and resilience of these intensively managed no-till agroecosystems. In this context, a descriptive meta-analysis was conducted of the literature on the use of specific cover crops in agricultural systems on Oxisol soils in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes of Brazil in order to survey and synthesize the available research. Effects on above and belowground processes and different sustainability metrics were analyzed with the goal of determining the contribution of cover crops to Amazonian agroecosystem sustainability. Future research plans will also be discussed, which include the establishment of a model farm and agricultural experiment research station, continuation of ongoing experiments, and outreach and extension activities with soybean and corn farmers and cattle ranchers from the region.</span></p>

<span>I am a Visiting Associate Professor from Brazil.

I am currently focusing on soil health and phosphorus (P) cycling and am researching species of plants that could be used as cover crops in these systems in order to boost P cycling through soil mining processes that would make more inorganic P available near the soil surface for subsequent absorption by cash crops in large- and small-scale agroecosystems. I am also interested in teaching all aspects of conservation agriculture techniques and their application to agroecosystems to students and landowners/farmers, and also identifying the needs of farmers and the barriers they may face with respect to the adoption of conservation agriculture management in their production systems.</span></p>

<p>Functioning organisms possess an abundant array of tissues, each composed of distinct cell types with distinct cell morphologies. How is this grand diversity of fates and forms generated? Cells in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage distill many of the key features of development: they must be chosen from initially equivalent cells, they undergo asymmetric and self-renewing divisions, they communicate among themselves and they must respond to the environment. Our lab takes a multidisciplinary approach&ndash;from cell biology to genomics to ecophysiology&ndash;that leverages the intrinsic strengths of this biological system to create a conceptual and technical framework for the study of cell fate, stem-cell self-renewal and cell polarity.</p>

While there have been significant advances over the past several decades, this level of control has yet to be fully realized and remains a major challenge in advancing new technologies. However, increasingly higher demands on materials performance, especially for systems dominated by interfaces, are inherent to meeting future societal needs. Progress has been inherently hindered by the lack of control of interactions at interfaces. A key challenge to investigating and engineering precise interfacial behavior stems from the fact that interfaces are buried underneath a bulk phase and involve only a small number of atoms and molecules compared to the bulk, which requires advanced experimental tools to reveal their properties. The research activities in my lab aim to provide critical insights into these issues, by exploiting a combination of novel experimental techniques and comprehensive modelling. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><span style=""font-size:11.0pt""><span>In my talk I will discuss our recent investigations on two different arenas: ionic liquids and hydrogel interfaces. Developed methods and progress in understanding structural and/or dynamic properties of the nanoconfined interfaces are discussed here. Specifically, our studies focus on obtaining a basic understanding of the principles underlying the properties of, and processes occurring at, these interfaces and soft films, to bridge the fundamental knowledge gap needed to advance a range of applications, from energy storage to biomaterials design. </span></span></span></span></p>

New and upgraded facilities are now making it possible to survey the cold interstellar medium efficiently for large galaxy samples, and these observations are proving to be critical in refining our general picture of galaxy evolution. &nbsp;In this talk, I will review results from a number of new large surveys for molecular gas and dust across the galaxy population at low and high redshifts, and show how they combine to lend strong support in favour of the &quot;equilibrium&quot; model for galaxy evolution, under which most of galaxy evolution is regulated by gas inflows and outflows, and by the efficiency of the star formation process. These results highlight the multi-scale nature of the galaxy evolution problem, and the need to investigate new tools to study the cold interstellar medium of distant galaxies.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

With no prevailing legal regime active in the country, those performing policing functions have frequently drawn on Islamic moral discourses to justify arrests, detentions, checkpoint stops, and other actions. This presentation takes a performance studies approach to instances of quotidian policing of music and their subversions in post-Gaddafi Libya in which actors make reference to religiosity or assumedly shared notions of virtue related to Islam. In so doing, I offer a critique of reigning frameworks which address the intersections of &ldquo;music and Islam&rdquo; while suggesting interdisciplinary methods through which the quotidian complexities of these intersections might be more substantively addressed. Weaving performance ethnography with a framework drawn from Islamic studies and performance studies, I illustrate how instances of quotidian policing are scenarios of social drama which both produce and are formulated through competing conceptualizations of Islam and of music, leveraging broad claims which then prescribe or predict possible action within the scenario.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span><span>Abstract: </span></span></span><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><span><span>State legitimacy and&nbsp;&nbsp;food security have historically been deeply entwined in China.&nbsp;</span></span><span>While China initially embraced genetically modified organisms (GMOs), vociferous controversy destabilized this consensus. Drawing on 37 interviews with key actors, 11 months of field-research, and textual analysis Chinese media sources, I leverage this controversy to make a dual-pronged argument. First, I show how the strategies employed in the construction of China&rsquo;s agrobiotech sector shape the unusual dynamics of the controversy. The Chinese state and its scientific allies have tried to &ldquo;purify&rdquo; GM-foodstuffs by portraying these crops and, by association, themselves, as national products tasked with rescuing the nation from starvation and foreign dependence. The critical idioms articulated against GMOs mimic these values and vocabulary, and thus, reproach state legitimacy. Second, I use the controversy to expose the instability of the co-opted expert position in a technocratic, authoritarian state. &ldquo;Science&rdquo; has become the dominant political ideology of contemporary China. This places China&rsquo;s GMO scientists in a difficult position. While researchers&rsquo; ties to the state have afforded them unprecedented influence over China&rsquo;s developmental trajectory, their politicized professional identity has also undercut their ability to make credible scientific claims in public controversies and made them targets of public censure. <span>&nbsp;Ultimately, I show that though science is called upon to bolster the state&rsquo;s legitimacy, scientific experts end up infected by the state&rsquo;s credibility crises themselves. Ultimately, in trying to depoliticize China&rsquo;s GMO controversy, science and scientists instead become reliant on the state for their own legitimacy.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span><span>Her various projects demonstrate that while the Chinese Communist party-state (CCP) seeks to harness science and technology as a legitimizing ideology and economic driver, semi-incorporating them within the state also gives rise to new, often unintended dynamics that the party-state must address.</span></span></span></p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration.

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Only in the last two centuries, it became dependent on fossil resources. The ability to store energy in a dense form and its ease of use led to unparalleled growth in science, technology and commerce, leading to a lifestyle for a common person that could not be imagined before. Chemical engineering saw an unprecedented growth as use of oil, natural gas and coal became dominant for transportation, production of chemicals and other human needs. However, as the world population rises from 7-10 billion towards a &lsquo;Full Earth&rsquo; and lifestyle improves in most parts of the world, the rapid rise in demand for energy will put tremendous pressure on the availability of fossil resources. Solar irradiation is the only power source that can meet daily needs for any foreseeable future. The question before us is&ndash;as we bid farewell to fossil to reembrace solar power, how will chemical engineering adapt? What is the role that we, systems engineers, can play in this change and evolution?</p>

<p>In order to understand the contributions that systems engineers could make, we will begin by understanding the great challenges that emerge due to the dilute nature of solar irradiation, the low efficiencies at which it is harnessed and its intermittency in availability. When on a daily basis, solar irradiation becomes the main supplier for food, energy, water, chemicals and other human needs, the chemical engineers will have new processes and energy systems to model. We will have to learn how to harness solar irradiation as electricity, heat, biomass, H2, etc. and transform some of these into usable forms such as fuels, fertilizers, chemicals, purified water, etc. Moreover, there are challenges related to large-scale storage of energy at GWhr levels to mitigate impact of intermittent availability.</p>

<p>We will present some results from our energy systems modeling highlighting the synergistic interactions that exist for transportation sector and production of chemicals. This will be followed by a discussion and analysis of candidate processes to produce hydrogen from solar energy, our modeling results for energy storage at giga Watt-hour levels and uninterrupted around the clock electricity production using new solar thermal power cycles with internal hydrogen circulation. Such cycles have a potential to not only supply solar thermal electricity at an unprecedented efficiency during the period while solar energy is available but have a potential to supply around the clock electricity with efficiencies similar to that from batteries storage, however, here energy is stored at a much higher density. We will then discuss our vision of how to use solar thermal processes to meet demand for water purification, chemicals and food.</p>

<p>Finally, we will present our ongoing research on modeling of agricultural farms with coproduction of electricity and food. The insights from these models are exciting and could pave a sustainable path towards &lsquo;Full Earth&rsquo;.</p>

PUSH mobilizes residents to create sustainable neighborhoods with quality affordable housing, green jobs, and next-generation infrastructure. PUSH's Green Development Zone, which combines green housing, job training, stormwater management, and urban agriculture in a district on Buffalo's West Side, was named the winner of the global Sustainable Housing competition sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Brazilian Ministry of Cities, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Bartley grew up in Buffalo and attended Buffalo Public Schools. He is a graduate of Swarthmore College and Harvard Law School, where he cofounded the Harvard Living Wage Campaign, which resulted in $10 million in annual wage and benefit increases for the low-income campus workers it represented.

Bartley writes columns on cities and community organizing at Huffington Post and has commented on community and labor issues in a wide variety of media outlets, including the New York Times, CNN, and the Wall Street Journal. He serves currently as a visiting scholar at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations.

Abstract:
For the past 14 years, Bartley worked with colleagues at PUSH Buffalo to build a model of community-controlled development in his hometown, a postindustrial city devastated by classism and racism and the hyperextractive process of deindustrialization. The organizers rooted their organization in the values and analysis of the Just Transition and Development Without Displacement movements. From the get-go, when finance capital was just beginning to scout the city, they knew that control of land was essential to realizing their dreams, and they began asserting ownership and control through every means available to them, from direct action at bank-owned vacant homes, to negotiation with the city for the purchase of vacant lots, to direct purchase from slum-lords disinvesting from the neighborhood.

Bartley intends this lecture to serve as both an exploration of the praxis and strategy underlying the battle for land and power in the gentrifying city, and as an airing of the contradictions and tensions within the movement. He will show as a proof of concept that, when organizers build unity, leadership, and organization in oppressed communities, they will rise to offer new and original solutions to climate change, financial extraction, police occupation, and cultural appropriation, solutions born out of struggle and lived experience that leverage collective power and networks to build cutting-edge systems like community-shared solar systems, agricultural commons, and cohousing that are largely unachievable in wealthier cities. Bartley will also attempt to problematize the constraints of the nonprofit industrial complex; the limits of the Community Development Corporation as both a real estate developer and a change agent; and the shortcomings and enduring value of Alinksy-influenced organizing practice in oppressed communities, with its often itinerant, middle-class, organizers, its lagging social analysis and keen sense of power and leverage, and the promise and limitations of emergent Gramsci and somatic-influenced organizing practice with forays into electoral politics, focus on culture-building, economic power, and attention to healing practice as a radical tool for social solidarity and personal transcendence."

<p><b>Research Focus</b></p>

<p>Chromosomes are covered with chemical modifications that help control gene expression. I study this secondary genetic code - the epigenome - and how it is guided by small mobile RNAs in plants and fission yeast. Our discoveries impact plant breeding and human health, and we use this and other genomic information to improve aquatic plants as a source of bioenergy.</p>

<p>Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation&mdash;chemical and conformational changes to DNA and the chromatin that bundles it&mdash;have had an important impact on genome organization and inheritance and on cell fate. These mechanisms are conserved in eukaryotes and provide an additional layer of information superimposed on the genetic code.&nbsp;<b>Robert Martienssen</b>, a pioneer in the study of epigenetics, investigates mechanisms involved in gene regulation and stem cell fate in yeast and model plants including&nbsp;<i>Arabidopsis</i>&nbsp;and maize. He and his colleagues have shed light on a phenomenon called position-effect variegation, caused by inactivation of a gene positioned near densely packed chromosomal material called heterochromatin. They have discovered that small RNA molecules arising from repeating genetic sequences program that heterochromatin. Martienssen and colleagues have described a remarkable process by which &ldquo;companion cells&rdquo; to sperm in plant pollen grains provide them with instructions that protect sperm DNA from transposon damage. They found that some of these instructions, or epigenetic marks, could be inherited in the next generation. These marks, and the small RNA responsible that guide them, can sense the number of chromosomes inherited from pollen and may allow&nbsp;<i>Arabidopsis</i>, a flowering plant, to produce egg cells without meiosis, an important step toward a long-time goal of plant breeding: generating clonal offspring to perpetuate hybrid vigor. The lab has also shown that when RNA polymerase II has transcribed a stretch of DNA, the RNA interference mechanism causes the enzyme to release its hold on the DNA and fall away. This allows the replication fork to progress smoothly and the DNA strands to be copied; histone-modifying proteins, which follow right along, establish heterochromatin. Martienssen&rsquo;s group also continues to work on problems related to the creation of plant-based biofuels. As part of a collaborative project to generate a high-quality full genome map of the oil palm plant, Martienssen and his colleagues identified a transposon whose modification controls the yield of oil palm trees. This discovery will increase yields and should lessen the environmental burden of oil palm production, which often threatens already endangered rainforest lands.</p>

Applying dimuon pT cuts of 25 GeV and 60 GeV, we explore two overlapping samples: one with isolated muons, and one with prompt muons without an isolation requirement. Using the latter sample requires information about detector effects and QCD backgrounds, which we obtain directly from the CMS Open Data. We present model-independent limits on the product of cross section, branching fraction, acceptance, and efficiencies. These limits are stronger, relative to a corresponding inclusive search without a pT cut, by factors of as much as nine. Our &quot;pT-enhanced&quot; dimuon search strategy provides improved sensitivity to models in which a new particle is produced mainly in the decay of something heavier, as could occur, for example, in decays of the Higgs boson or of a TeV-scale top partner. An implementation of this method with the current 13 TeV data should improve the sensitivity to such signals further by roughly an order of magnitude.</span></span></span></p>

<p><i><b>Combining DNA Synthesis, Multiplexed Reporters, and Genome Engineering to better Understand Human Gene Regulation and Protein Function</b></i><br />
<u>Abstract:</u> Our laboratory develops new methods that link a genetic function such as transcription, splicing, or signal transduction, to a barcoded reporter that can be identified and measured by next-generation sequencing (rather than say luminescence or fluorescence). This allows us to molecularly multiplex hundreds to thousands of such experiments in a single flask, and to use large-scale DNA synthesis as a way to explore these sequence-function relationships. In this talk, I will discuss two of our lab&#39;s efforts in bringing these practices to problems in human biology. In the first, we explore how extant human genetic variation affects the process of exon recognition during pre-mRNA splicing using a new multiplexed assay in human cell lines. We find a surprisingly large number of rare genetic variants lead to large-effect loss of exon recognition. In the second, we develop a new reporter for G-protein coupled receptor signal transduction and use this system to characterize signal transduction for all possible single amino acid mutations to the beta-2-adrenergic receptor and uncover novel motifs required for signal transduction. In addition, we use this system to explore questions of ligand specificities in mammalian olfactory receptors.</p>

<span style=""font-size:15pt""><span><span><span><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span><span>This talk will cover the theoretical development of the Extended Symmetric Galerkin Boundary Element Method (X-SGBEM), a numerical framework proposed for 2D and 3D general crack growth simulations that allows the intersection of cracks with outer boundaries. This framework&nbsp; merges numerical concepts from Extended Finite Element Method (X-FEM)/Partition of Unity Method (PUM) and the SGBEM for linear elastic fracture simulations allowing for discontinuities to intersect. Boundary Element Methods are preferred for linear elastic fracture calculations, as they are highly accurate and can be implemented into algorithms that are significantly faster than the frameworks developed for fracture mechanics using the Finite Element Method (X-FEM, phase-field/variational model for fracture). Boundary Element Methods have the advantage that only the boundaries and the cracks need to be modeled in the domain of interest; this facilitates minimal requirements for remeshing. Higher order crack tip elements can also provide precise fracture information (stress intensity factors) without requiring extremely fine meshing. Up until this day, there is no mathematically rigorous, optimized scheme that allows Boundary Element Methods to handle crack intersections with other surfaces (whether we are referring to other cracks or outer boundaries) without significant remeshing. Such a numerical technique could facilitate the study of fatigue crack growth and microcracking in brittle linear elastic materials, as well as simulations of fracture networks in geomaterials. This talk will include a review of prior developments of SGBEM in the context of fracture&nbsp; mechanics, and cover current developments of X-SGBEM.<br />

<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span>The massive datasets now commonplace in many fields of industry and science hold the promise of significantly changing our understanding of the world around us. Key to the fulfillment of this promise however, is the ability to perform computationally efficient statistical inference on such large datasets. This motivates one of the key questions in theoretical data science, to understand which statistical inference tasks are impossible, which are possible but computationally infeasible for large datasets, and which enjoy efficient estimation procedures.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span>In this talk, we will focus on an important class of estimation problems that are rich in algebraic structure. Motivated by problems in signal/image processing, and computer vision we will address the task of estimating a signal, image, tri-dimensional structure/scene from measurements corrupted not only by noise but also by latent transformations. Many such transformations can be described as a group acting on the object to be recovered. Examples include the Simulatenous Localization and Mapping (SLaM) problem in Robotics and Computer Vision, where pictures of a scene are obtained from different positions and orientations;&nbsp;Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) imaging where projections of a molecule density are taken from unknown rotations, and several others.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span>One fundamental example of this type of problems is Multi-Reference Alignment: Given a group acting in a space, the goal is to estimate an orbit of the group action from noisy samples. For example, in one of its simplest forms, one is tasked with estimating a signal from noisy cyclically shifted copies. We will show that the number of observations needed by any method has a surprising dependency on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and algebraic properties of the underlying group action. Remarkably, in some important cases, this sample complexity is achieved with computationally efficient methods based on computing invariants under the group of transformations; while in others fundamental computational bottlenecks seem to arise.</span></span><br />

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span>The document to be read in the session is part of a study that investigates the practical use of stone steles erected in local society during the Song Dynasty (960-1279). Stone steles (or more precisely, their inscriptions) examined in this research are those in commemoration of local administrative issues, such as tax reduction, levy exemption, and welfare projects. This research places the creation and use of the commemorative steles in the center of analysis. In addition to the recorded subjects, specific attention will be paid to the seemingly peripheral information&mdash;why and how the commemorative steles were made, who the authors and audiences were, and how the steles were used (and expected to function). By doing so, the research aims to explore political culture and the operation of the Song state.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Consumer-driven health care is often heralded as a new quality paradigm in medicine. However, patients-as-consumers face difficulties in judging the quality of their medical treatment. With a sample of 3,000 U.S. hospitals, we find that neither medical quality nor patient survival rates have much impact on patient satisfaction with their hospital. In contrast, patients are very sensitive to the &lsquo;room and board&rsquo; aspects of care that are highly visible. Quiet rooms have a larger impact on patient satisfaction than medical quality, and communication with nurses affects satisfaction far more than the<br />
hospital-level risk of dying. Hotel experiences create a halo effect of patient goodwill, while medical excellence and patient safety do not. Moreover, when hospitals face greater competition from other hospitals, patient satisfaction is higher but medical quality is lower. Consumer-driven health care creates pressures for hospitals to be more like hotels.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E. Green, the Gale and Ira Drukier Curator of European and American Art, Prints &amp; Drawings, 1800&ndash;1945, at the Johnson, and supported in part by the Helen and Robert J.

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

<p>This work was&nbsp;acquired for the Johnson Museum&#39;s permanent collection through the Stern Family Contemporary Art Acquisition Fund (2018.039).</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

 Science and Geography.  His pursuit for his passion continued with the completion of a permaculture design certificate from the finger lakes 
 permaculture institute in 2013. Since then Dominic has dedicated his life to studying fungi, working on several mushroom farms as well as managing one. When Dominic isn't working at Blackdiamond Farm and Cider or Stonecat Cafe you most often can find him in the woods foraging for fungi.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E.

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

They are based on Hering&rsquo;s theory of opponent color vision in which three orthogonal, opponent color channels are present: red-green, yellow-blue and white-black. Unique red and unique green are defined as hues that contain neither yellow nor blue. Unique yellow and unique blue are hues that contain neither red nor green. UHs can be determined for self-luminous or object stimuli. Unique hue data obtained under different illumination conditions allow one to test the validity of uniform color spaces such as CIELAB and CIECAM based models, which are widely used in industrial applications. Unique hues could also serve as a set of hues that should be preserved when viewed on different displays and could be useful constraints for gamut mapping algorithms. Techniques employed to determine UHs include selection of object color patches from Munsell samples and NCS color set by a group of observers over repeated trials, among other techniques.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><span style=""font-size:13.0pt"">There are various factors that influence the perception of UHs. In this presentation, we will review some of these parameters including chroma and stimulus size under various light sources that simulate specific illuminants. The presentation will include a discussion of experiments involving data collected from color-normal observers who selected samples representing uH stimuli in repeated trials. One study included two sets of high chroma chips that varied in size, one at 5.7<sup>o</sup> field of view size and the other at 1.4<sup>o</sup>. The second study involved a set of low chroma and a set of high chroma samples of the same size.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><span style=""font-size:13.0pt"">The uH responses obtained from all observers are used to calculate the frequency and mean for the selected stimuli. These frequencies represent substantial variability among observers and show variations based on illumination and viewing conditions. We have found that the mean uH responses are also significantly different based on the colorfulness of the stimuli. Variability among observers is also found to be hue dependent. These pose interesting questions about the nature of uHs and whether neuro-physiological models can be used to address their origins. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><span style=""font-size:13.0pt"">Nonetheless, benefits of studying uHs for basic color vision research include specification of a set of salient colors in a device-independent space where results can be comparable across different laboratories. This would be similar to currently used definitions in terms of cone space as adopted by the CIE. Additionally experimental color vision research, preferentially stimulating higher-order color mechanisms may be shown to be more appropriate than employing stimuli that isolate receptoral or post-receptoral mechanisms.

To increase the cooling rate, Derbenev and Litvinenko proposed Coherent electron Cooling (CeC), which makes use of the large bandwidth of a Free Electron Laser to amplify the hadron signal. This talk describes an alternative CeC scheme using the microbunching instability as the amplifier.&nbsp; I will also describe a method for suppressing shot noise fluctuations in the electron beam current to further improve cooling rates.</span></span></p>

He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><b>Abstract:</b> Regression discontinuity design (RDD) has gained traction across social science fields as a leading quasi-experimental strategy to assess policy impacts. Graphical presentation is to a large extent responsible for this growing popularity, and it is now an integral part of any well-executed RDD study. The key graph in any RD paper plots the bivariate relationship between the outcome variable Y and running variable X, and is meant to convey a discontinuity or the lack thereof in the conditional expectation function as X crosses a policy threshold. A number of recommendations have been made on how to construct these graphs, but it is not clear which practitioners should follow.&nbsp; Since the success of a graphical technique ultimately lies in the correct subjective perception of the reader, we propose a &quot;experimental&quot; approach to evaluate competing RD graphical methods by aggregating readers&#39; perceptions through crowdsourcing. We conduct a series of randomized experiments where we present RD plots based on data generating processes specified on datasets from published papers and generated by different graphical parameters. Each participant in the experiment is shown a series of graphs, asked to classify the existence of a discontinuity in the graphs, and financially rewarded for correct classifications. We also study graphical presentation in the regression kink design with an analogous approach.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><b><i>Potential vs. Realized Savings under Automatic Enrollment</i></b></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp; <span style=""font-size:12pt""><span>Employer adoption of automatic enrollment can dramatically increase retirement savings plan participation. However, many savings plan participants withdraw some, or even all, of their accumulated balances prior to reaching retirement. The extent to which individuals&rsquo; pre-retirement withdrawal decisions months or even years after they have been automatically enrolled offset the increased savings induced by automatic enrollment is an open question. We explore this issue by studying the evolution of retirement savings outcomes over time for the employees at five firms introducing automatic enrollment between 2005 and 2010. Comparing employees hired in the twelve months after the introduction of automatic enrollment to those hired in the twelve months prior, we find that automatic enrollment increases total potential retirement system balances by 3.2-17.5% of starting pay 84 months after hire; at the same time, leakage in the form of outstanding loans and withdrawals that are not rolled over into another qualified savings plan also increase by 0.9-3.8% of starting pay, offsetting between 5.3-47.3% of the potential increase in savings from automatic enrollment. The net effect is that automatic enrollment increases retirement system balances by 1.7-16.5% of first year pay 84 months after hire.</span></span></p>

For example, simulations can provide invaluable insights on the physics of scramjet engine cold-start, thereby helping design successful injection strategies. However, simulating such flow configurations presents unique difficulties in maintaining both robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we have designed an all-Mach, compressible multiphase flow solver that utilizes a low-dissipation transport scheme to accurately represent turbulence in smooth, single-phase regions and applies a robust semi-Lagrangian scheme to handle discontinuous transport at interfaces and shocks. We employ a pressure projection scheme to avoid acoustic limitations on the time-step size. Within this framework, we have implemented specific treatments of the volume fraction, pressure, and energy equations to improve stability.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

This provides my audience with an overview of how my anthropological investigations of change, in its many forms, evolved into both a focus on inhabitants&rsquo; perceptions, understandings and responses to the local effects of global climate change and, concomitantly, on to other drivers of change, most prominently economic globalization and intergenerational alienation. I then use examples of my research in the last decade in other cultural contexts (and including the Chesapeake Bay) to show how these drivers similarly challenge a myriad of rural communities&rsquo; sustainable futures. Second, based upon my almost thirty years of anthropological engagement described above, I clarify how, as a result, I maintain two central focal points as anthropological contributions towards transformative change: knowledge systems and narratives. After clarifying both, I provide several distinct examples of my present work in knowledge systems and narratives as anthropological contributions towards interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to issues of global change. In my third presentation portion, I take my research and teaching experiences to date to show how I can imagine these contributions in the context of both Cornell&rsquo;s Atkinson Center for Sustainability and its Anthropology Department. </span></p>

Architected materials such as cellular solids, micro- and nano-lattices, multi-phase composite structures and self-assembled nanostructures are at the core of this shift. This is due to their unique properties that are derived by their intricate architecture- a combination of topology, material distribution and base material(s) composition properties. The complex interplay of these features leads to a wide range of deformation mechanisms that include nonlinear elastic instabilities, plastic deformation and collapse, brittle fracture, and shock-type collapse. This talk will focus on our ongoing efforts to connect key morphological characteristics to the resulting material properties for three different problems: the crushing of open-cell foams, elastic wave propagation in regular and disordered cellular materials, and the mechanical properties of DNA nanostructures.</p>

The right scheduling policy can dramatically reduce response times, ensure fairness, provide class-based priority, etc., without requiring additional resources. While stochastic response time analysis of different scheduling policies has been the focus of thousands of theoretical papers, results are limited to analyzing a relatively small number of &quot;simple&quot; scheduling policies.</p>

<p>In this talk, we introduce the SOAP class of scheduling policies: Schedule Ordered by Age-based Priority. The SOAP policies include almost all scheduling policies in the literature as well as an infinite number of variants which have never been analyzed, or maybe even conceived. SOAP policies include the highly intractable SERPT policy (Shortest-Expected-Remaining-Processing-Time), as well as the famously complex Gittins Index policy. SOAP also includes all sorts of &quot;combination&quot; policies, like a policy that performs Shortest-Job-First on jobs with known size and Foreground-Background scheduling on jobs with unknown size, or a policy that is allowed to preempt jobs only when they hit certain ages. In this talk we present a stochastic response time analysis of all SOAP policies via a single universal framework. If time permits, we will also discuss some open problems in scheduling of current interest.</p>

Engines of economic growth are readjusting to the &ldquo;new normal.&rdquo; Overall, institutions as &ldquo;the rules of the game&rdquo; can no longer be viewed as static and invisible. Instead, a series of the rules of the game &mdash; ranging from national and international politics to technological standards and competition policies &mdash; are changing, and their complexities are increasing. Such institutional transitions are forcing managers and entrepreneurs to search for new, innovative strategies.</p>

<p>We welcome papers that analyze the interaction between global strategy and emerging markets, and especially those that focus on the theme of the conference: how firms led by managers and entrepreneurs eager to grow strategically respond to a new global economy with such heightened institutional complexities.</p>

<p>Examples of Related Topics</p>

<ul>
	<li>How do forces of &ldquo;de-globalization&rdquo; affect long-term strategic thinking?</li>
	<li>How do technological advances (such as the &ldquo;internet of things&rdquo; and artificial intelligence) influence entrepreneurial behavior?</li>
	<li>How do societal and environmental changes (such as global warming, migration and aging population) provoke new growth opportunities or depress such opportunities?</li>
	<li>What are the responses of firms from developed economies to changes in emerging markets?</li>
	<li>Are firms from emerging markets likely to become more or less interested in internationalization?</li>
	<li>How have U.S. firms responded to the country&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)? How have firms in the other TPP countries reacted to these changes?</li>
	<li>What strategies are Canadian, Mexican and U.S. firms using to cope with the uncertainties surrounding the future of NAFTA/USMCA?</li>
	<li>What scenarios of Brexit are UK firms preparing? How do firms from the rest of the EU respond?</li>
	<li>How have Chinese firms responded to the &ldquo;One Belt, One Road&rdquo; initiative? How do firms based in the &ldquo;One Belt, One Road&rdquo; zone respond?</li>
	<li>How can existing theories contribute to a better understanding of some of these important but underexplored questions? If existing theories are inadequate, how can we develop new ones?</li>
</ul>

<p>We invite you to submit complete papers (40 double-spaced pages, following&nbsp;<i>Academy of Management Journal</i>&nbsp;guidelines)&nbsp;<u>OR</u>&nbsp;proposals (5 single-spaced pages, following Strategic Management Society conference guidelines), especially from junior scholars/doctoral students.</p>

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E. Green, the Gale and Ira Drukier Curator of European and American Art, Prints &amp; Drawings, 1800&ndash;1945, at the Johnson, and supported in part by the Helen and Robert J.

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span>Rural communities and social organizations in Montes de Mar&iacute;a have been historically excluded from the planning and public decision-making processes that take place in their own territories. But, what happens when they are purposefully convened by the State to conduct a region-wide rural development, participatory the planning process? What visions about the future and development priorities for their territories emerge? How do rural, peasant, afro and indigenous communities imagine their development? Are there similar visions between different communities in the same region? Can a common, region-wide vision of territorial development be identified? Are the communal visions of development significantly different from those that have been traditionally imposed upon them through the political process? To answer these questions, I present an analysis of the Communal Pacts for Regional Transformation (PCTRs ) that were constructed by the communities and social organizations of the fifteen municipalities that comprise the Montes de Mar&iacute;a region during a months-long participatory planning process for the design of the Development Programs with Territorial Focus (PDETs ) derived from the Peace Agreement signed by the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People&rsquo;s Army (FARC-EP). The analysis focuses on the visions of rural development expressed by the communities in the Communal Pacts, and how these visions contrast with those held by the local, regional and national political and economic elites.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><span><span><span>Based on three years&rsquo; field study and participatory observation, </span>my dissertation and the current talk based on it <span>traces and compares major S&amp;T controversies &ndash; hydropower resistance, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) controversy and nuclear power debate &ndash; in contemporary China. By </span>integrating different theoretical approaches,<span> it analyzes communication, sociopolitical and knowledge factors associated with and underlying their emergence and evolvement. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span><span>The resistance of hydropower controversy is a typical reflection of the rising environmentalism and ENGOs that have effectively utilized emerging public environmental awareness, bureaucratic fragmentation, publicness pursuing media, and the shackled knowledge-control regimes to successfully suspend nearly all targeted dams in the past 16 years, while widespread GMO controversy represents a story of how civic epistemology can challenge biotechnologists&rsquo; knowledge-control regimes and break their fragile science-politics alliance. Since 2006, China has not commercialized any GM crops. By contrast, nuclear power has shown both narrow political opportunity structure and very strong knowledge-control regimes, thanks to its lack of bureaucratic fragmentation, its historical glory and a lack of public attention. </span></span></span><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span>As a result, the debate only temporarily postponed construction of new nuclear power plants.</span></span></p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

399,1541675,"Undressed: The Nude In Context, 1500-1750",https://events.cornell.edu/event/undressed_the_nude_in_context_1500-1750,2019-05-09T10:00:00-04:00,"","<p>The early years of the Renaissance brought about renewed interest in the idealized proportions and smooth and languid gestures of Greco-Roman sculptures, which became the preferred model for the then-contemporary nude figure. However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

<p>Many of the ways we use mobile and social media today have longstanding precedents in historical media like letters, diaries, scrapbooks, and home movies. What we think of as the &lsquo;social media revolution&rsquo; is part of a much longer story about the use of media for connecting people through the documenting and sharing of everyday life. Placing mobile and social media into a longer historical context helps to reveal what is really new about these contemporary communication technologies, what future services might learn from historical communication practices, and what fundamental aspects of the human experience emerge through a variety of technological platforms.</p>

<p>What You&rsquo;ll Learn:</p>

<ul>
	<li>How aspects of social media communication are rooted in older forms of media</li>
	<li>How social media is changing the way we document and share everyday life</li>
	<li>How fundamental aspects of the human experience emerge through social platforms</li>

437,1615458,Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration,https://events.cornell.edu/event/unturned_leaves,2019-05-10T08:00:00-04:00,"","<p>Until only recently, science has generally been associated with the work of men, and its leading figures have generally been those endowed with the means&nbsp;to acquire an education and the time to pursue interest in scientific discovery and exploration. Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them. Mann Library has developed this exhibit in conjunction with the<a href=""https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2019/03/her-natural-history.html""> Her Natural History celebration </a>sponsored by partners of the Biodiversity Heritage Library for Women&#39;s History Month 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E. Green, the Gale and Ira Drukier Curator of European and American Art, Prints &amp; Drawings, 1800&ndash;1945, at the Johnson, and supported in part by the Helen and Robert J.

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

As the military situation deteriorated, the Song court requested the local governments to exhaust all means to extract resources from the local society. While contemporary historians are aware of the fiscal&nbsp;crisis in the Song dynasty, the ways in which this crisis influenced local society has yet been fully investigated. In this session, the speaker will use one example to show how local officials responded to the financial pressures from the court, and how this financial effort led to further problems in the locality. There will be an introduction focusing on the political and social context of a county, Liyang, which is in southeast China, followed by a close reading of a text about the destruction of a local cult. Together we will decipher the financial concerns in the disguise of religious problems in the local society.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Each piece was researched and based on a particular specimen within the collections of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Herbarium at Cornell, or the C. V. Starr Virtual Herbarium.

Plants are monitored each year to evaluate the impact of deer browsing. AVID is a method for volunteers, foresters, landowners and others to measure the effect of deer browse on New York forests. Volunteers are encouraged to use AVID to document this aspect of New York forest health. Participants will learn about forest and woodland ecology, how to identify spring wildflowers and trees, and develop an eye for recognizing signs of deer impacts.


Individuals can use AVID by printing field data sheets and entering the data online here at this web site, or through a smart phone app available for either Apple or Android phones at Apple Store or Google Play Store. Field data collected by individuals and organizations across New York State, and submitted to this central database, will be used to track tree, shrub and wildflower response to deer browsing over time. Knowledge of how deer impacts change through time will help guide deer management decisions at local and state levels. Participants will document changes in forest plants on their own land, or land in their communities, and also will learn:


To identify important spring wildflower and tree species
To recognize evidence of deer impacts based on the presence or absence of key wildflower, shrub, and tree indicator species




Kristi Sullivan, Cornell University Department of Natural Resources and a developer of the AVID protocol will train volunteers interested in learning about this easy, rapid assessment method for evaluating deer impacts.


The training will be 9:30 am - 2 pm. A bag lunch will be served. 


Registration fee is $10 payable by cash or check at the door. There is a field component to this training session. Dress for the weather, including appropriate footwear.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E.

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E. Green, the Gale and Ira Drukier Curator of European and American Art, Prints &amp; Drawings, 1800&ndash;1945, at the Johnson, and supported in part by the Helen and Robert J.

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

<p>This work was&nbsp;acquired for the Johnson Museum&#39;s permanent collection through the Stern Family Contemporary Art Acquisition Fund (2018.039).</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales.

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

When the solution to a business problem or opportunity involves a software component, the solution team must determine how software will best support the business. A use case diagram clearly depicts the scope of the solution to be designed which can help set expectations for stakeholders as to the complexity and interactions with the system. This class focuses on the business analysis work of defining functional, non-functional, and transition requirements which describe the solution and roll out needs. In addition to use case modeling, this course provides guidelines for developing system and user interfaces, a checklist for non-functional requirements, and strategies for developing an implementation plan. These are critical components in fully defining your solution requirements.&nbsp;*Breakfast at 8am&nbsp;&amp; Lunch at Noon - both included*</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

When the solution to a business problem or opportunity involves a software component, the solution team must determine how software will best support the business. A use case diagram clearly depicts the scope of the solution to be designed which can help set expectations for stakeholders as to the complexity and interactions with the system. This class focuses on the business analysis work of defining functional, non-functional, and transition requirements which describe the solution and roll out needs. In addition to use case modeling, this course provides guidelines for developing system and user interfaces, a checklist for non-functional requirements, and strategies for developing an implementation plan. These are critical components in fully defining your solution requirements.&nbsp;*Breakfast at 8am&nbsp;&amp; Lunch at Noon - both included*</p>

At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration.

Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>In the company of local guides, we will also take in the extraordinary beauty of these countries and their wealth of native plants and animals. On Mauritius, we&#39;ll go to Black River Gorge, the Seven Colored Earth at Charmarel, and Pamplemousses Botanical Garden.

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

East Meadow, NY  11554


Presented by: Nicole Borukhov


Fee: $20 per person 


We have trillions of microscopic organisms living in our gut and the interaction between these microflorae can have a huge impact on the human body. Research suggests a strong association between the amount and types of bacteria in our gut and chronic conditions like obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. In this workshop, we focus on methods for modulating our microflorae and how prebiotics and probiotics can keep our gut happy and healthy.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

This program will be a 2 step opportunity:


Step 1—Attend an educational workshop on June 8 from 10-12 noon at the Marilla Methodist Church.  You will learn about the history of pie making, food safety, fruit preparation, crust preparation and the “how to” by making your own personal mini pie.  This workshop will be presented by Christine Basile.


Step 2—Participate in the actual pie making.  You will make 2 pies, one for the auction and one for the 4-H member to take home (to bake and eat or freeze to bake later to exhibit at the fair) at Daily's in East Aurora and in July. 


Please note: 1 parent/adult must accompany youth during both sessions"

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years.

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

<p>The second part of the mushroom course offerings, this course will provide practical instruction for designing and building controlled atmosphere mushroom production spaces. Learn&nbsp;the basic techniques and equipment required to start producing mushrooms on a small scale commercially. Focus will be on the importance of proper design, layout, and equipment so that profitable production can be achieved using limited space and labor.&nbsp;Recommended prerequisite: Learning to Work with Mushrooms &amp; Fungi.</p>

<p>This course will be taught by Eric Myers of Myers Mushrooms. Eric is currently serving as a Technical Sargent in the United States Air Force as a Vehicle Mechanic and has been growing mushrooms commercially at home for 4 years. In 2015 he realized the potential for gourmet mushroom production in small spaces, as well as the market demand for gourmet mushrooms to be local. This inspired him to start producing mushrooms in his garage. Eric has shared his experience and his designs via his popular YouTube channel, which has provided thousands of growers with examples oftools and methods for efficient indoor mushroom cultivation. Eric developed and refined a low-pressure single-drum sterilizer, an alternative to commercial autoclaves, which equipped small scale mushroom growers with an affordable, easy to build, commercial grade option for bulk substrate sterilization. In 2017 Eric launched his Hands-on Cultivation Class and has since been mentoring hundreds of small-scale growers across the US. Eric and his family recently relocated with the military to Haysville, KS andexpanded to a 2,400 sq/ft warehouse. This workshop will be an accelerated version of Eric&rsquo;s 2-day Hands-on Cultivation Class.</p>

<p>This workshop will be held at the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.equicenterny.org/copy-of-equicenter-farm"">EquiCenter Farm</a>, and lunch is provided.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is recommended that students arrive around 9:30 a.m. to get coffee, tea and snacks, and get checked-in and settled before the class begins.</p>

Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

<p>This work was&nbsp;acquired for the Johnson Museum&#39;s permanent collection through the Stern Family Contemporary Art Acquisition Fund (2018.039).</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

<p>When Oscar Fingal O&#39;Flahertie Wills Wilde (1854-1900) left colonial Dublin to take metropolitan England by storm, he established himself as one of the funniest, most consequential figures in literary history.</p>

<p>At Oxford, he was a disciple of the Aestheticism/Decadence movement fostered by fellow intellectuals and artists who promoted &quot;art for art&#39;s sake,&quot; a stance swiftly parodied by the establishment. By the early 1890s, Wilde became famous for his epigrammatic wit, wildly popular novels, and plays brimming with social satire.</p>

<p>As a trailblazer for gay liberation, Wilde&#39;s 1895 trial and conviction for sodomy helped to create twentieth-century gay identity, the &quot;love that dared not speak its name.&quot; It can be argued that Wilde&#39;s own life, though it ended tragically, was his greatest work of art. We&#39;ll visit some of Cornell&#39;s rich literature collections and read The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) and other writings, including Wilde&#39;s dramatic masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest (1895).</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration.

Judging will take place here at CCE Oneida, in Oriskany


If you enjoy working with youth and have an interest in encouraging the efforts of 4-H Members, I encourage you to register as a Volunteer Evaluator.  Judges will earn $50 which can be donated back to the 4-H Department if so desired*.


Youth may submit in the following areas:



Communications and Expressive Arts- Posters, Scrapbooks, Banners......
Arts and Crafts
Clothing and Textiles
Home Furnishings- Furniture, Pillows, Wall Hangings........
Visual Arts-Photography, Video, PowerPoint.....
Natural Resources-Wildlife, Recycling.......
Entomology
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)
Geo Spatial, Rockets
Woodworking
Gardening
Food

All youth submitting projects to the fair must have a face to face evaluation with a judge (that's you).  Youth will bring you a project.  You discuss the project with youth asking questions like: ""What did you learn? Where did you get the idea? What would you do different?""  After meeting with the youth you will complete an evaluation form.  Give the project to a youth helper and note if you think the project is good enough to be sent on to the State Fair.


Youth wishing to register as Assistants will be responsible for taking projects to and from the judges. Setting up and breaking down tables.  Packing up supplies.


Adult volunteers are needed to work the scoring and ribbon tables.


Judges should plan on arriving at 5pm at CCE Oneida.  We will serve a light supper, wraps, chips and drinks.  At 5:15 we will hold judges orientation and judging will start at 5:30pm


Youth assistants and other volunteers should plan on arriving at 4:30pm to assist with set up and organizing the event. Supper will be provided at 5pm wraps, chips and drinks.


Youth submitting projects, will be arriving between 5:30 and 6:30pm.  Once all projects have been evaluated judges will be released.  I expect everyone will be finished by 8pm.


Thanks to those individuals that donated the $50 back to Oneida County 4-H last year.  Because of you we were able to create several opportunities for 4-H Youth to express and challenge their creativity.  Your donation allowed us to provide the supplies for the Art in the Bucket Challenge, Horse and Cow Cut-outs.  I hope you will all have the ability to meet and evaluate the youth that your donation supported."

He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>&quot;Humor must not professedly teach, and it must not professedly preach, but it must do both if it would live forever.&quot; So said Mark Twain. In this class, we&#39;ll try to define the American sense of humor.</p>

<p>Among a wealth of sources, we&#39;ll look at the frontier humor of Twain; analyze Charlie Chaplin&#39;s tramp and vaudeville&#39;s appeal to immigrants; consider American romantic comedies and TV sitcoms; and discuss Woody Allen&#39;s distinctive brand of humor. We&#39;ll also consider American political satire from George Carlin to P. J. O&#39;Rourke, Jon Stewart, and Stephen Colbert. Our earnest (and occasionally less than earnest) efforts to characterize American humor will be led by no less a wit than Glenn C. Altschuler, the Thomas and Dorothy Litwin Professor of American Studies.</p>

<p>Come prepared to read, listen, discuss, and laugh.</p>

<p>This program is part of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.sce.cornell.edu/cau/index.php"">Cornell&rsquo;s Adult University</a>&nbsp;(CAU), which offers education vacations designed and led by Cornell faculty.

<p>Does God exist? Do humans have free will? And most important, how can we truly be happy? We&#39;ll discuss these and other big philosophical questions as classicist Michael Fontaine leads us through&nbsp;<i>On the Nature of Things (De Rerum Natura)</i>&nbsp;by the first-century BCE Roman poet Lucretius, who wrote some of the finest Latin verses from the ancient world.</p>

<p>As an apostle of Greek philosopher Epicurus, Lucretius based his work on his mentor&#39;s ancient study of atomism, a precursor to today&#39;s atomic theory. Epicureanism contends that the world is made of matter created by natural, not supernatural, laws, that there is no afterlife, that happiness is the highest human goal, and that humans are capable of morality and self-fulfillment without gods. This secular philosophy dominated the ancient world for centuries until it was knocked off its throne by Christianity. We&#39;ll also find out which American founding father quietly subscribed to Epicurean thought.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them. Mann Library has developed this exhibit in conjunction with the<a href=""https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2019/03/her-natural-history.html""> Her Natural History celebration </a>sponsored by partners of the Biodiversity Heritage Library for Women&#39;s History Month 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration.

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

<p>What can account for the &quot;Janemania&quot; of our time and Jane Austen&#39;s phenomenal popularity? The answer lies in her deep and enduring understanding of people&mdash;their strengths and their follies.</p>

<p>Wendy Jones, practicing psychotherapist, literature professor, and author of&nbsp;<i>Jane on the Brain: Exploring the Science of Social Intelligence with Jane Austen</i>, will lead our consideration of Austen&#39;s insight. We&#39;ll pay close attention to the novels themselves&mdash;we&#39;ll read and discuss&nbsp;<i>Persuasion</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Sense and Sensibility</i>&mdash;and to the science of social intelligence. In both venues, we&#39;ll explore the profound human need for connection, attachment, and love, as well as our capacity for distance, denial, and narcissism. In lecture and discussion, this fusion of literature, psychology, and neuroscience will give us a heightened understanding both of one of our most beloved authors&mdash;and of our own minds.</p>

<p>&quot;The point of theater is transformation: to make an extraordinary event of ordinary material right in front of an audience&#39;s eyes,&quot; says English playwright Lee Hall. We will explore five such transformations during CAU&#39;s sixteenth journey to the perennially exciting London stage, with its varied and riveting productions.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll enjoy plays in the West End and at the Royal National Theatre, framed by illuminating pre-performance lectures and post-performance discussions led by <a href=""https://www.sce.cornell.edu/cau/faculty/index.php?id=91"">David Feldshuh</a> and <a href=""https://www.sce.cornell.edu/cau/faculty/index.php?id=89"">Glenn Altschuler</a> (who will select the plays this winter). Enriching our visit, we will meet with a British actor from one of our productions and take a fascinating tour of the West End.</p>

<p>A practicing director, actor, and playwright, David will focus our attention on the theatrical possibilities and challenges of each production, while Glenn will emphasize the themes and contexts of the plays. Together, they will help us explore the imaginative process involved in transforming the written script of each play into a dynamic theatrical experience.</p>

Wittig&rsquo;s legacy, both literary and conceptual, does not reflect her work&rsquo;s boldness and significance. This is due in part to the way Wittig has been cleaved in two, her literary production cut off from her critical, theoretical production. Her reception in the American academy tends toward the latter: amplified by Judith Butler&rsquo;s account of Wittig in&nbsp;<i>Gender Trouble&nbsp;</i>(1990),&nbsp;<i>The Straight Mind&nbsp;</i>(1992)<i>&nbsp;</i>has had considerable traction as a work of feminist theory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In &ldquo;Monique Wittig&rsquo;s Labors,&rdquo; I put Wittig the writer and Wittig the theorist back together. I demonstrate how for Wittig, these two strands of production are coextensive. Wittig always insisted on her identity as a writer, first and foremost, because of the way literature reveals language&rsquo;s materiality in a way that purely critical writing cannot, bringing our body and language&rsquo;s into a&nbsp;<i>corps-&agrave;-corps</i>. This revelation calls on us as readers to assume a writerly relation to language and engage in the difficult labor that a writerly writer does of working with this material that is as resistant as it is malleable.</p>

<p>Outside Geneva, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, is home to the world&#39;s most powerful particle accelerator&mdash;the Large Hadron Collider.</p>

<p>Every several years the collider is shut down for enhancements and visitors are allowed underground. We will take advantage of the 2019 shutdown to descend five stories into the heart of Atlas, largest of the four detectors at CERN, for a close-up view of the most sophisticated piece of scientific equipment in the history of mankind.</p>

<p>While in Switzerland, we will learn about the dawn of modern physics and Albert Einstein&#39;s work, especially in Bern, where he developed his Theory of Relativity, which revolutionized the way we think about space and time today and culminated in the greatest engineering project of all time, the LHC.</p>

<p>One of our two faculty leaders for this rare and wonderful opportunity, is Cornell physicist <a href=""https://www.sce.cornell.edu/cau/faculty/index.php?id=467"">Julia Thom-Levy</a>, who, with her Cornell research team, is currently designing and constructing a silicon pixel detector to be flown to CERN for the Large Hadron Collider upgrade.</p>

<p>Our second leader is physicist <a href=""https://www.sce.cornell.edu/cau/faculty/index.php?id=468"">Stephen Levy</a>, who has done groundbreaking work in experimental particle physics at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.</p>

<p>In addition, we&#39;ll also visit art museums to see works of Swiss artists, including those of Paul Klee, son of Bern. Along the way, we&#39;ll explore Chillon Castle and relish a variety of Swiss delights, from fondue to chocolate to delicious Swiss wines.</p>

In many settings, users can more easily and accurately respond to preference queries reflecting their current, or recently experienced, context (e.g., state of the environment), than those reflecting contexts further removed. We develop and study a formal model of experiential elicitation (EE) in which query costs and response noise are state-dependent. EE settings tightly couple the problems of control and elicitation. We provide some analysis of this abstract model, and illustrate its applicability in household heating/cooling management. We propose the use of relative value queries, asking the user to compare the immediate utility of two states, whose difficulty is related to the degree and recency of a user&rsquo;s experience with those states. We develop a Gaussian process-based approach for modeling user preferences in dynamic EE domains and show that it accrues higher reward than several natural baselines.<br />

While we are typically a cost-recovery group, we are offering this free training given the importance of this topic at Cornell and Higher Ed in general. We want to promote awareness and provide campus with the tools to perform your testing and address any found issues, which will help make Cornell&rsquo;s web space accessible for all.

<p>With its lush rainforests, pristine coastal beaches, diverse animal life, and friendly culture, Costa Rica is a memorable destination for adults and families with children.</p>

<p>In the company of superb naturalist and evolutionary biologist <a href=""https://www.sce.cornell.edu/cau/faculty/index.php?id=195"">Scott Taylor</a>, we&#39;ll ascend the world-famous Irazu Volcano to enjoy the breathtaking view from the 11,000-foot summit. At Tortuguero National Park&mdash;a plant, wildlife, and bird paradise&mdash;we&#39;ll visit the Sea Turtle Conservancy and kayak through the park&#39;s maze of canals and thick mangrove trees, observing monkeys, iguanas, and crocodiles. On a jungle boat expedition, we&#39;ll close in on river otters, caiman, and poison dart frogs and disembark to observe three-toed sloths, river turtles, toucans, and parrots.</p>

<p>En route to the Manuel Antonio National Park on the Pacific, we&#39;ll zipline, swing, and rappel through the forest canopy. At the park, we&#39;ll savor our accommodations at the luxurious Hotel Parador Resort and Spa, with its self-guided garden and wildlife trails and dance parties for all ages. We&#39;ll walk, swim, snorkel, and maybe even learn to surf. Before parting, we&#39;ll also stop for an outrigger canoe trip.</p>

The cost is $15.  Celebrate St. Paddy’s Day this year with your own homemade corned beef and Irish soda bread!


At the workshop we will show you how to “corn” your own beef (or venison) to use in the traditional corned beef and cabbage recipe.  You will also learn how to make Irish soda bread.  Cornell Cooperative Extension of Seneca County’s Nutrition Issue Leader, Moira Tidball, along with Nutrition Educator, Candace Riegel, will lead the workshop.  Participants will be served a bowl of corned beef and cabbage and will go home with recipes and materials to confidently prepare this Irish fare at home."
