Seven species displayed represent a small percentage of plants that are either extirpated (SX) or considered endangered historical species (SH), not having been recorded in 20-30 years. Each piece was researched and based on a particular specimen within the collections of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Herbarium at Cornell, or the C. V. Starr Virtual Herbarium. These embossings serve as a personal homage to the absence of an increasing number of this region&#39;s flora from their botanic communities.</p>

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>
