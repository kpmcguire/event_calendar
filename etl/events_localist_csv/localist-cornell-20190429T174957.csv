A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them. Mann Library has developed this exhibit in conjunction with the<a href=""https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2019/03/her-natural-history.html""> Her Natural History celebration </a>sponsored by partners of the Biodiversity Heritage Library for Women&#39;s History Month 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Dr. Hess&rsquo;s research interests are in thin film science and technology, surface and interface modification and characterization, microelectronics processing and electronic materials. His group focuses on the establishment of fundamental structure-property relationships and their connection to chemical process sequences used in the fabrication of novel films, electronic materials, devices, and nanostructures. Control of the surface properties of materials such as dielectrics, semiconductors, metals, and paper or paper board by film deposition or surface modification allows the design of such surfaces for a variety of applications in microelectronics, packaging, sensors, microfluidics, and separation processes.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://hess.chbe.gatech.edu/"">Hess group</a>&nbsp;often uses glow discharges or plasmas for the deposition, etching, and polymerization of thin films or for the modification of surfaces. For example, plasma-deposited fluorocarbon films are being used to generate superhydrophobic paper and cellulose surfaces for self-cleaning and microfluidic applications. The design of novel, low temperature plasma etching processes for the nano-scale patterning of copper films for advanced integrated circuit fabrication is also of interest. Surface cleaning and modification for control of material properties using a variety of liquid and vapor phase approaches are being investigated.</p>

<p>Our group also uses liquids at atmospheric and elevated pressures for environmentally benign surface cleaning and modification. &nbsp;In particular, we are designing solution-based methods for the modification of cellulose/paper, polymers, and metals to control liquid droplet wetting, adhesion, and absorption.&nbsp;&nbsp;These studies&nbsp;are applied to integrated circuit processing sequences, packaging, and water/oil separation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Hess is the Thomas C. DeLoach, Jr. Chair and former director of Georgia Tech&rsquo;s NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) for New Electronic Materials.</p>

After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

The method of choice in deep learning to solve this problem is by training a deep auto-encoder. My main result states that the complexity of learning this deeply-sparse coding model is given by the maximum, across layers, of the product of the number of active neurons (sparsity) and the embedding dimension (of the sparse vector).

<p><b>Cohort Effects of Restrictive Abortion Legislation --- Evidence from 19th Century Law Variation </b><br />
Joanna N. Lahey, Marianne H. Wanamaker and Elizabeth Oltmans Ananat<br />
<br />
<b>Abstract:</b> Standard models of fertility predict that lowering the cost of abortion will raise the average socioeconomic status of born children and improve the average long-run outcomes of birth cohorts. Empirical results from 1970&rsquo;s abortion legalization in the United States largely confirm this prediction. We generalize a model of fertility to reflect conditions in less developed countries and highlight assumptions under which the standard model&rsquo;s predictions can be overturned. In particular, high returns to child labor, budget constraints for low-income households, and high discount rates for lower socioeconomic status households can each overturn the standard prediction wherein easing abortion access raises average socioeconomic status of birth cohorts. Moreover, by incorporating cohort size effects in the prediction of long-run outcomes for marginal children, we show that the net effects of abortion legalization, which reflect both child selection and cohort size effects, are ambiguous. Our empirical analysis, focused on abortion restrictions in the 19th century U.S., demonstrates these points. Children born under more restrictive abortion access have higher socioeconomic status at birth than their peers. Nevertheless, larger cohorts induce additional mortality, particularly at younger ages.</p>

Beyond trees, not all links are beneficial: An agent&rsquo;s learning deteriorates when her neighbors are linked to each other, and when her neighbors learn from herself. These results imply that an agent&rsquo;s favorite network is the directed star with herself at the center, and that learning is better in &ldquo;decentralized&rdquo; networks than &ldquo;centralized&rdquo; networks.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

While official documentation of war time atrocities remains sparse and difficult to access, film, fiction, personal essays and memoir provide a rich archive to personal and national suffering during the War of Independence. Building on the arguments that human rights narratives have the capacity to bolster/impede human rights advocacy and render legible what cannot be verified by raising the possibility and impossibility of recuperating narratives of violence, this paper explores the necessity of an &lsquo;ethical engagement&rsquo; with irrecuperable human catastrophe such as the genocide of 1971. Specifically, I analyze Nasiruddin Yousuff&rsquo;s <i>Guerrilla</i> (2011), a contemporary popular film, which engenders public dialogue on gender, healing and agency and contributes to the broader quest for political and social justice for survivors of 1971. My purpose is not to recuperate the catastrophic past, in fact in itself an impossible endeavor; nevertheless, I argue that an ethical reckoning moves us to reflect upon artistic/filmic abstractions of social abjections as a political project. If we accept that catastrophic loss and harm exceed representation, we can nevertheless strive for an ethical engagement that elicits a deeper appreciation of differentiated agency, vulnerability, and humanity.</span></span></span></span></p>

329,1646780,Evaluating and creating genomic tools in Cassava breeding,https://events.cornell.edu/event/evaluating_and_creating_genomic_tools_in_cassava_breeding,2019-04-29T12:20:00-04:00,"","<p>The genetic improvement of <i>Manihot esculenta</i>, or cassava, has historically been slow, largely because its biology renders traditional breeding techniques inefficient and because of little interest from the private sector. The goal of the Next Generation Cassava Breeding project (NEXTGEN) is to assist breeding institutions in Nigeria, Uganda, and Tanzania with increasing the rate of genetic improvement of cassava through implementation of genomic selection (GS). My presentation outlines my work with NEXTGEN and is split into three sections. The first section details my investigation of two questions: 1) can we use existing imputation methods developed by the human genetics community to impute missing genotypes in datasets derived from non-human species and 2) are these methods, which were developed and optimized to impute ascertained variants, amenable for imputation of missing genotypes at next-generation sequencing (NGS)-derived variants? In the second section, I introduce a statistical method, BIGRED (Bayes Inferred Genotype Replicate Error Detector), for detecting mislabeled and contaminated samples using shallow-depth sequence data. BIGRED addresses key limitations of existing approaches and produced highly accurate results in simulation experiments. In the third section, I outline how we used the multi-generational pedigree and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) to characterize the recombination landscape across the 18 chromosomes of cassava. We detected SNP intervals containing crossover events using SHAPEIT2 and duoHMM, constructed a genetic map using these intervals, compared it to an existing map constructed by the International Cassava Genetic Map Consortium (ICGMC), and constructed sex-specific genetic maps to see if cassava displays sexual dimorphism in crossover distribution and frequency.</p>

(<a href=""http://www.atkinson.cornell.edu/Assets/ACSF/docs/events/Adamson-Poster.pdf"">poster</a>)</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p><i>In this talk, I will bring Richard Power&rsquo;s Pulitzer Prize winning novel The Overstory (2018) into conversation with James Cameron&rsquo;s futuristic blockbuster film, Avatar (2009), Colombian-American filmmaker Juan Carlos Galeano&rsquo;s documentary The Trees Have a Mother (2010), Jack Arnold&rsquo;s Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954) and the film it inspired, Guillermo Del Toro&rsquo;s Academy Award winning The Shape of Water (2017). &nbsp;In Galeano&rsquo;s film, Amazonian forest dwellers and fisher persons discuss their relationships to forest and river spirits collectively referred to as &ldquo;persons&rdquo; named Sachamama (Mother of the Forests) and Yakumama (Mother of all Water Beings) and understood as protector beings. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll explore the resonances between these earth spirits and Power&rsquo;s &ldquo;mother&rdquo; redwood tree Mimas, Cameron&rsquo;s Hometree and Del Toro&rsquo;s Gillman. I&rsquo;ll set my reading into the context of the loggers, miners, oil companies, agribusiness enterprises, and cocaine producers that the indigenous people in Galeano&rsquo;s film accuse of failing to ask &ldquo;permission from the mothers of the trees&rdquo; before they destroy the forest and contaminate the river. &nbsp;In Amazonia, anthropomorphic stories about &ldquo;mothers,&rdquo; understood not as female-gendered entities but as &ldquo;source of life,&rdquo; are still common. </i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll examine how they are employed as a disanthropocentric strategy for critiquing legal and economic analytics that are used to justify development schemes that put vulnerable peoples at increased risk for environmental harms. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll end with some thoughts about how the emerging science of biosemiotics which inspires The Overstory and Avatar and illuminates The Shape of Water is revealing the communicative capabilities of nonhumans and undergirding ongoing work to grant legal personhood or &ldquo;standing&rdquo; to nature in courts, constitutions, and governing agendas.</i></p>

<p>Filmmakers and food lovers Jen and Grant dive into the issue of waste from farm, through retail, all the way to the back of their own fridge. After catching a glimpse of the billions of dollars of good food that is tossed each year in North America, they pledge to quit grocery shopping cold turkey and survive only on foods that would otherwise be thrown away. In a nation where one in 10 people is food insecure, the images they capture of squandered groceries are both shocking and strangely compelling.&nbsp;Just Eat It looks at our systemic obsession with expiry dates, perfect produce and portion sizes, and reveals the core of this seemingly insignificant issue that is having devastating consequences around the globe.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them. Mann Library has developed this exhibit in conjunction with the<a href=""https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2019/03/her-natural-history.html""> Her Natural History celebration </a>sponsored by partners of the Biodiversity Heritage Library for Women&#39;s History Month 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<p>As we all mostly agree, the main driver of climate change is the human. &nbsp;Since the United Nations 2012 Earth Summit produced the outcome document, &ldquo;The Future We Want,&rdquo; there have been calls for change in the ways research on the &ldquo;human factor&rdquo; is done and growing interest in &ldquo;co-designed&rdquo; projects led by interdisciplinary teams of natural and social scientists, humanists and artists. But long before 2012, humanities disciplines, including philosophy, history, religious studies, gender studies, language and literary studies, and psychology, among others, were beginning to coalesce into a new field offering deep insights into human motivations, values, and choices and reconceive &ldquo;the relationship between scientific and technical disciplines and the humanities&rdquo; (Emmett and Nye 2016).&nbsp;</p>

<p>This talk will briefly survey the field as it is burgeoning into an international network of tens of thousands of researchers, new programs, initiatives and funding, at most large universities around the world. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll focus on the Andrew Mellon-funded project, Humanities for the Environment, a consortium of eight observatories that is networking universities in North America, Africa, Australia-Pacific, Circumpolar, East Asia, Asia Pacific, Europe, and Latin America. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll highlight some of the most promising humanities-led projects, focusing on food, water, and extinction, which are foregrounding the importance of story, narrative, imagination, historical baselines, counterfactual thinking, and scenario-building for overcoming the inertia, or lack of action, often associated with the litanies of inequity, trauma, extreme weather, extinction, and displacement becoming more commonly associated with climate change. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll explore how projects such as these might contribute to the mission of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future and how they are working to build greater capacity for purposeful collective community and governmental action in diverse communities interested in designing more just, livable, and thriveable &ldquo;futures we want.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

The goal is to discover clusters of vertices in a graph based on the edges of the graph. Much work has focused on evaluation of algorithms, including message passing algorithms, for a particular generative model, namely, the stochastic block model. The stochastic block model is a variant of Erdos-Renyi type graph. In this talk we focus on the problem of community detection for the Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment model with communities, defined by J. Jordan. In such model, vertices are sequentially attached to the graph, with preference to attach more edges to existing vertices with larger degrees, multiplied by affinities based on community membership. While more complicated than SBM, it is shown that the model has sufficient structure to formulate approximate belief propagation algorithms for community detection.</p>

Both groups were victims of discrimination and immigration restrictions, but both have also been stereotyped as &quot;model minorities&quot; defined by upward mobility and success in American capitalist society. This lecture examines how Asians and Jews epitomize the concept of &quot;overrepresented minorities,&quot; groups that are highly vulnerable in part because they are perceived as successful and privileged.

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales.

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

For quantum magnets with geometrical frustration, quantum fluctuation usually lifts the macroscopic classical degeneracy, and exotic quantum states emerge. However, how different types of quantum processes entangle wave functions in a constrained Hilbert space is not well understood. Here, we study the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) and the thermal entropy of a quantum ice model on a geometrically frustrated kagome lattice. We find that the system does not show a Z2 topological order down to extremely low temperature, yet continues to behave like a classical kagome ice with finite residual entropy. Our theoretical analysis indicates an intricate competition of off-diagonal and diagonal quantum processes leading to the quasi-degeneracy of states and effectively, the classical degeneracy is restored. </span></span></span></p>

In particular, I explore how such uncertainty interacts with demand fluctuations and firms&#39; strategic incentives. I construct and estimate a dynamic oligopoly model in which agents do not know the true parameters in the demand process, but form and revise their beliefs based on information available at each decision-making moment. I find that uncertainty about the demand process amplifies investment cycles through (i) leading firms to revise beliefs more drastically as they experience demand fluctuations, and (ii) intensifying strategic incentives among firms.</span></span></span></p>

Drawing on six years of fieldwork, this research shows how vendors&rsquo;&nbsp;<i>paisano&nbsp;</i>(hometown compatriot) social networks are structured to both benefit and exploit its members. While much of the work on newly arrived Latino immigrants focuses on the ways in which their social networks allow them to survive, Rosales argues that this understanding of ethnic community simplifies the complex ways in which social networks and social capital work.

<p>Abstract:&nbsp;<span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span>Attention and emotion are core psychological systems. The things we selectively process and how we feel about&nbsp;them shapes our experiences, thoughts, and behaviors. It is widely understood that emotion drives attention. Our&nbsp;lab has examined the reverse: Attention drives emotion. Experiments using multiple procedures demonstrate that&nbsp;voluntary, targeted, and incidental attention intensifies emotional experience. For example, people perceive target&nbsp;objects they have searched for as more emotionally intense than control objects. And when attention is spatially&nbsp;oriented toward one object rather than another, people perceive the attended object as more intense. These&nbsp;effects are largely because attention increases vividness. Attention&rsquo;s intensifying effects have broad implications&nbsp;for judgment and decision making. Attention influences consumer budgeting and increases risk aversion.&nbsp;Importantly, attention influences environmental judgments and decisions. Attention increases perceptions of&nbsp;environmental risks and reduces people&rsquo;s tendency to steeply discount future environmental outcomes. As&nbsp;William James expressed, attention determines our experience of life.</span></span></p>

Drawing from his forthcoming book Refashioning Masculinity: Men and Fashion in the Digital Age (University of Chicago Press), Ben will explore how fashion as an industry, a trend and an everyday social practice resists and transforms dominant ideas and ideals about masculinity. He will question whether current movements in men&rsquo;s fashion are systemically or stylistically refashioning the gender order.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span><span style=""font-size:14.0pt""><span>To perform their function, biological systems need to operate across multiple scales. Current techniques in structural and cellular biology lack either the resolution or the context to observe the structure of individual biomolecules in their natural environment, and are often hindered by artifacts. Our goal is to build tools that can reveal molecular structures in their native cellular environment. Using the power of cryo-electron tomography (CET) to image biomolecules at molecular resolution in situ, we are building tools to make compatible with, and directly comparable to, biophysical and cell biology experiments, capturing the structural behavior of macromolecules in action under controlled conditions. I will show how we used these techniques to reveal the structure of LRRK2, the greatest known genetic contributor to Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, and to reveal the molecular architecture of bacterial cells.</span></span></span></span></p>

Thursday, May 2, 2019


4:30pm to 6:00pm


Cornell Cooperative Extension of Wyoming County


36 Center Street, Warsaw, NY 14569


Cost is $10 per person or $5 per person for CCE Ag Dept Enrollees


Come learn how high tunnels work to grow crops throughout the year. This session will focus on crops grown in the tunnels during the colder months and timing your transition to warm weather plantings like peppers, tomato, and cucumbers. Whether you are looking to get an early start in the spring, grow later into the fall, or even keep cold hardy plants alive throughout the winter, this session will have information you need. Demonstration will include a comparison of size and quality, of late fall planted/over wintered greens, spinach and lettuce, to early spring plantings. We will gather indoors and then take a short walk out to the on-site high tunnel. The session will be primarily outdoors in the high tunnel, so please dress for the weather. If you arrive late and would like to catch up with the group, the high tunnel is south of the building perpendicular to the large white barn.


Discussion Topics to Include:


 High Tunnel Basics, Site Selection, and Orientation


 Timing Cool Weather Plantings


 Temperature Control within High Tunnels


 Transitioning from Cold Weather Crops to Warm Weather Crops


 Irrigation of Cold Weather Crops vs. Warm Weather Crops


 Fertilization


 Common Pests and Disease


 Use of Row Cover for Overwintering Crops


 Resources


 Q and A on Everything High Tunnel

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E.

Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

The method characterizes linear dynamics around a steady state when that steady state differs from any individual agent&#39;s long run expectation. It applies when agents agree to disagree, as well as when they differ in aversion to Knightian uncertainty and hence behave as if they hold different worst case beliefs. It thus provides a simple way to study effects of uncertainty on behavior in linear models. Our leading example looks at precautionary savings, asset premia and gains from insurance in a borrower-lender model with agents </span></span>who differ in uncertainty aversion.</span></span></span></p>

Citizens are swayed by politicians because they expect their&nbsp;partisan peers to toe the party line&mdash;and people are loath to disagree with partisan peers. Although daunting, an&nbsp;appreciation of psychological barriers suggests strategies to overcome them. For example, learning that other&nbsp;members of one&rsquo;s political group support climate policy substantially increases one&rsquo;s own support for climate&nbsp;policy. And structured reflection on personal beliefs about good citizenship reduces political polarization over&nbsp;climate policy. These findings can inform grassroots efforts to more effectively lobby for climate policy. They also&nbsp;illustrate how psychological scientists can help address climate change.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></i></p>

The area planted with soybeans in the Amazon biome of Brazil was about 4.5 million hectares in 2018, and together with the area planted with corn in the region there are nearly 8 million hectares of these crops, the majority of which are managed using no-till techniques. Across a large portion of this area the use of cover crops is either nonexistent or incipient, and their use in agricultural systems is not based on research but is instead empirical and consists of just a few species. Due to factors such as low soil fertility, high rainfall rates, and a strong dry season coupled with more frequent and severe droughts, the incorporation of a cover crop into soybean and corn rotations is a logical next step towards increased sustainability and resilience of these intensively managed no-till agroecosystems. In this context, a descriptive meta-analysis was conducted of the literature on the use of specific cover crops in agricultural systems on Oxisol soils in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes of Brazil in order to survey and synthesize the available research. Effects on above and belowground processes and different sustainability metrics were analyzed with the goal of determining the contribution of cover crops to Amazonian agroecosystem sustainability. Future research plans will also be discussed, which include the establishment of a model farm and agricultural experiment research station, continuation of ongoing experiments, and outreach and extension activities with soybean and corn farmers and cattle ranchers from the region.</span></p>

I am currently focusing on soil health and phosphorus (P) cycling and am researching species of plants that could be used as cover crops in these systems in order to boost P cycling through soil mining processes that would make more inorganic P available near the soil surface for subsequent absorption by cash crops in large- and small-scale agroecosystems. I am also interested in teaching all aspects of conservation agriculture techniques and their application to agroecosystems to students and landowners/farmers, and also identifying the needs of farmers and the barriers they may face with respect to the adoption of conservation agriculture management in their production systems.</span></p>

<p><b>Research Focus</b></p>

<p>Functioning organisms possess an abundant array of tissues, each composed of distinct cell types with distinct cell morphologies. How is this grand diversity of fates and forms generated? Cells in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage distill many of the key features of development: they must be chosen from initially equivalent cells, they undergo asymmetric and self-renewing divisions, they communicate among themselves and they must respond to the environment. Our lab takes a multidisciplinary approach&ndash;from cell biology to genomics to ecophysiology&ndash;that leverages the intrinsic strengths of this biological system to create a conceptual and technical framework for the study of cell fate, stem-cell self-renewal and cell polarity.</p>

While there have been significant advances over the past several decades, this level of control has yet to be fully realized and remains a major challenge in advancing new technologies. However, increasingly higher demands on materials performance, especially for systems dominated by interfaces, are inherent to meeting future societal needs. Progress has been inherently hindered by the lack of control of interactions at interfaces. A key challenge to investigating and engineering precise interfacial behavior stems from the fact that interfaces are buried underneath a bulk phase and involve only a small number of atoms and molecules compared to the bulk, which requires advanced experimental tools to reveal their properties. The research activities in my lab aim to provide critical insights into these issues, by exploiting a combination of novel experimental techniques and comprehensive modelling. </span></span></span></span></p>

With no prevailing legal regime active in the country, those performing policing functions have frequently drawn on Islamic moral discourses to justify arrests, detentions, checkpoint stops, and other actions. This presentation takes a performance studies approach to instances of quotidian policing of music and their subversions in post-Gaddafi Libya in which actors make reference to religiosity or assumedly shared notions of virtue related to Islam. In so doing, I offer a critique of reigning frameworks which address the intersections of &ldquo;music and Islam&rdquo; while suggesting interdisciplinary methods through which the quotidian complexities of these intersections might be more substantively addressed. Weaving performance ethnography with a framework drawn from Islamic studies and performance studies, I illustrate how instances of quotidian policing are scenarios of social drama which both produce and are formulated through competing conceptualizations of Islam and of music, leveraging broad claims which then prescribe or predict possible action within the scenario.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span><span>Abstract: </span></span></span><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><span><span>State legitimacy and&nbsp;&nbsp;food security have historically been deeply entwined in China.&nbsp;</span></span><span>While China initially embraced genetically modified organisms (GMOs), vociferous controversy destabilized this consensus. Drawing on 37 interviews with key actors, 11 months of field-research, and textual analysis Chinese media sources, I leverage this controversy to make a dual-pronged argument. First, I show how the strategies employed in the construction of China&rsquo;s agrobiotech sector shape the unusual dynamics of the controversy. The Chinese state and its scientific allies have tried to &ldquo;purify&rdquo; GM-foodstuffs by portraying these crops and, by association, themselves, as national products tasked with rescuing the nation from starvation and foreign dependence. The critical idioms articulated against GMOs mimic these values and vocabulary, and thus, reproach state legitimacy. Second, I use the controversy to expose the instability of the co-opted expert position in a technocratic, authoritarian state. &ldquo;Science&rdquo; has become the dominant political ideology of contemporary China. This places China&rsquo;s GMO scientists in a difficult position. While researchers&rsquo; ties to the state have afforded them unprecedented influence over China&rsquo;s developmental trajectory, their politicized professional identity has also undercut their ability to make credible scientific claims in public controversies and made them targets of public censure. <span>&nbsp;Ultimately, I show that though science is called upon to bolster the state&rsquo;s legitimacy, scientific experts end up infected by the state&rsquo;s credibility crises themselves. Ultimately, in trying to depoliticize China&rsquo;s GMO controversy, science and scientists instead become reliant on the state for their own legitimacy.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span><span>More about the speaker: Abigail Coplin is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the university of Pennsylvania Center for the Study of Contemporary China.&nbsp; She will be starting as an assistant professor in sociology and science, technology and society at Vassar College this fall.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span><span>Her various projects demonstrate that while the Chinese Communist party-state (CCP) seeks to harness science and technology as a legitimizing ideology and economic driver, semi-incorporating them within the state also gives rise to new, often unintended dynamics that the party-state must address.</span></span></span></p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration.

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Only in the last two centuries, it became dependent on fossil resources. The ability to store energy in a dense form and its ease of use led to unparalleled growth in science, technology and commerce, leading to a lifestyle for a common person that could not be imagined before. Chemical engineering saw an unprecedented growth as use of oil, natural gas and coal became dominant for transportation, production of chemicals and other human needs. However, as the world population rises from 7-10 billion towards a &lsquo;Full Earth&rsquo; and lifestyle improves in most parts of the world, the rapid rise in demand for energy will put tremendous pressure on the availability of fossil resources. Solar irradiation is the only power source that can meet daily needs for any foreseeable future. The question before us is&ndash;as we bid farewell to fossil to reembrace solar power, how will chemical engineering adapt? What is the role that we, systems engineers, can play in this change and evolution?</p>

<p>In order to understand the contributions that systems engineers could make, we will begin by understanding the great challenges that emerge due to the dilute nature of solar irradiation, the low efficiencies at which it is harnessed and its intermittency in availability. When on a daily basis, solar irradiation becomes the main supplier for food, energy, water, chemicals and other human needs, the chemical engineers will have new processes and energy systems to model. We will have to learn how to harness solar irradiation as electricity, heat, biomass, H2, etc. and transform some of these into usable forms such as fuels, fertilizers, chemicals, purified water, etc. Moreover, there are challenges related to large-scale storage of energy at GWhr levels to mitigate impact of intermittent availability.</p>

<p>We will present some results from our energy systems modeling highlighting the synergistic interactions that exist for transportation sector and production of chemicals. This will be followed by a discussion and analysis of candidate processes to produce hydrogen from solar energy, our modeling results for energy storage at giga Watt-hour levels and uninterrupted around the clock electricity production using new solar thermal power cycles with internal hydrogen circulation. Such cycles have a potential to not only supply solar thermal electricity at an unprecedented efficiency during the period while solar energy is available but have a potential to supply around the clock electricity with efficiencies similar to that from batteries storage, however, here energy is stored at a much higher density. We will then discuss our vision of how to use solar thermal processes to meet demand for water purification, chemicals and food.</p>

<p>Finally, we will present our ongoing research on modeling of agricultural farms with coproduction of electricity and food. The insights from these models are exciting and could pave a sustainable path towards &lsquo;Full Earth&rsquo;.</p>

PUSH mobilizes residents to create sustainable neighborhoods with quality affordable housing, green jobs, and next-generation infrastructure. PUSH's Green Development Zone, which combines green housing, job training, stormwater management, and urban agriculture in a district on Buffalo's West Side, was named the winner of the global Sustainable Housing competition sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Brazilian Ministry of Cities, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Bartley grew up in Buffalo and attended Buffalo Public Schools. He is a graduate of Swarthmore College and Harvard Law School, where he cofounded the Harvard Living Wage Campaign, which resulted in $10 million in annual wage and benefit increases for the low-income campus workers it represented.

Bartley writes columns on cities and community organizing at Huffington Post and has commented on community and labor issues in a wide variety of media outlets, including the New York Times, CNN, and the Wall Street Journal. He serves currently as a visiting scholar at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations.

Abstract:
For the past 14 years, Bartley worked with colleagues at PUSH Buffalo to build a model of community-controlled development in his hometown, a postindustrial city devastated by classism and racism and the hyperextractive process of deindustrialization. The organizers rooted their organization in the values and analysis of the Just Transition and Development Without Displacement movements. From the get-go, when finance capital was just beginning to scout the city, they knew that control of land was essential to realizing their dreams, and they began asserting ownership and control through every means available to them, from direct action at bank-owned vacant homes, to negotiation with the city for the purchase of vacant lots, to direct purchase from slum-lords disinvesting from the neighborhood.

Bartley intends this lecture to serve as both an exploration of the praxis and strategy underlying the battle for land and power in the gentrifying city, and as an airing of the contradictions and tensions within the movement. He will show as a proof of concept that, when organizers build unity, leadership, and organization in oppressed communities, they will rise to offer new and original solutions to climate change, financial extraction, police occupation, and cultural appropriation, solutions born out of struggle and lived experience that leverage collective power and networks to build cutting-edge systems like community-shared solar systems, agricultural commons, and cohousing that are largely unachievable in wealthier cities. Bartley will also attempt to problematize the constraints of the nonprofit industrial complex; the limits of the Community Development Corporation as both a real estate developer and a change agent; and the shortcomings and enduring value of Alinksy-influenced organizing practice in oppressed communities, with its often itinerant, middle-class, organizers, its lagging social analysis and keen sense of power and leverage, and the promise and limitations of emergent Gramsci and somatic-influenced organizing practice with forays into electoral politics, focus on culture-building, economic power, and attention to healing practice as a radical tool for social solidarity and personal transcendence."

<p>Rob Martienssen is a Professor and HHMI Investigator at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He received his PhD from Cambridge University in 1986. He has received numerous awards and honors, including being elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2006 and a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2010.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Research Focus</b></p>

<p>Chromosomes are covered with chemical modifications that help control gene expression. I study this secondary genetic code - the epigenome - and how it is guided by small mobile RNAs in plants and fission yeast. Our discoveries impact plant breeding and human health, and we use this and other genomic information to improve aquatic plants as a source of bioenergy.</p>

<p>Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation&mdash;chemical and conformational changes to DNA and the chromatin that bundles it&mdash;have had an important impact on genome organization and inheritance and on cell fate. These mechanisms are conserved in eukaryotes and provide an additional layer of information superimposed on the genetic code.&nbsp;<b>Robert Martienssen</b>, a pioneer in the study of epigenetics, investigates mechanisms involved in gene regulation and stem cell fate in yeast and model plants including&nbsp;<i>Arabidopsis</i>&nbsp;and maize. He and his colleagues have shed light on a phenomenon called position-effect variegation, caused by inactivation of a gene positioned near densely packed chromosomal material called heterochromatin. They have discovered that small RNA molecules arising from repeating genetic sequences program that heterochromatin. Martienssen and colleagues have described a remarkable process by which &ldquo;companion cells&rdquo; to sperm in plant pollen grains provide them with instructions that protect sperm DNA from transposon damage. They found that some of these instructions, or epigenetic marks, could be inherited in the next generation. These marks, and the small RNA responsible that guide them, can sense the number of chromosomes inherited from pollen and may allow&nbsp;<i>Arabidopsis</i>, a flowering plant, to produce egg cells without meiosis, an important step toward a long-time goal of plant breeding: generating clonal offspring to perpetuate hybrid vigor. The lab has also shown that when RNA polymerase II has transcribed a stretch of DNA, the RNA interference mechanism causes the enzyme to release its hold on the DNA and fall away. This allows the replication fork to progress smoothly and the DNA strands to be copied; histone-modifying proteins, which follow right along, establish heterochromatin. Martienssen&rsquo;s group also continues to work on problems related to the creation of plant-based biofuels. As part of a collaborative project to generate a high-quality full genome map of the oil palm plant, Martienssen and his colleagues identified a transposon whose modification controls the yield of oil palm trees. This discovery will increase yields and should lessen the environmental burden of oil palm production, which often threatens already endangered rainforest lands.</p>

Applying dimuon pT cuts of 25 GeV and 60 GeV, we explore two overlapping samples: one with isolated muons, and one with prompt muons without an isolation requirement. Using the latter sample requires information about detector effects and QCD backgrounds, which we obtain directly from the CMS Open Data. We present model-independent limits on the product of cross section, branching fraction, acceptance, and efficiencies. These limits are stronger, relative to a corresponding inclusive search without a pT cut, by factors of as much as nine. Our &quot;pT-enhanced&quot; dimuon search strategy provides improved sensitivity to models in which a new particle is produced mainly in the decay of something heavier, as could occur, for example, in decays of the Higgs boson or of a TeV-scale top partner. An implementation of this method with the current 13 TeV data should improve the sensitivity to such signals further by roughly an order of magnitude.</span></span></span></p>

<p><i><b>Combining DNA Synthesis, Multiplexed Reporters, and Genome Engineering to better Understand Human Gene Regulation and Protein Function</b></i><br />
<u>Abstract:</u> Our laboratory develops new methods that link a genetic function such as transcription, splicing, or signal transduction, to a barcoded reporter that can be identified and measured by next-generation sequencing (rather than say luminescence or fluorescence). This allows us to molecularly multiplex hundreds to thousands of such experiments in a single flask, and to use large-scale DNA synthesis as a way to explore these sequence-function relationships. In this talk, I will discuss two of our lab&#39;s efforts in bringing these practices to problems in human biology. In the first, we explore how extant human genetic variation affects the process of exon recognition during pre-mRNA splicing using a new multiplexed assay in human cell lines. We find a surprisingly large number of rare genetic variants lead to large-effect loss of exon recognition. In the second, we develop a new reporter for G-protein coupled receptor signal transduction and use this system to characterize signal transduction for all possible single amino acid mutations to the beta-2-adrenergic receptor and uncover novel motifs required for signal transduction. In addition, we use this system to explore questions of ligand specificities in mammalian olfactory receptors.</p>

<span style=""font-size:15pt""><span><span><span><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span><span>This talk will cover the theoretical development of the Extended Symmetric Galerkin Boundary Element Method (X-SGBEM), a numerical framework proposed for 2D and 3D general crack growth simulations that allows the intersection of cracks with outer boundaries. This framework&nbsp; merges numerical concepts from Extended Finite Element Method (X-FEM)/Partition of Unity Method (PUM) and the SGBEM for linear elastic fracture simulations allowing for discontinuities to intersect. Boundary Element Methods are preferred for linear elastic fracture calculations, as they are highly accurate and can be implemented into algorithms that are significantly faster than the frameworks developed for fracture mechanics using the Finite Element Method (X-FEM, phase-field/variational model for fracture). Boundary Element Methods have the advantage that only the boundaries and the cracks need to be modeled in the domain of interest; this facilitates minimal requirements for remeshing. Higher order crack tip elements can also provide precise fracture information (stress intensity factors) without requiring extremely fine meshing. Up until this day, there is no mathematically rigorous, optimized scheme that allows Boundary Element Methods to handle crack intersections with other surfaces (whether we are referring to other cracks or outer boundaries) without significant remeshing. Such a numerical technique could facilitate the study of fatigue crack growth and microcracking in brittle linear elastic materials, as well as simulations of fracture networks in geomaterials. This talk will include a review of prior developments of SGBEM in the context of fracture&nbsp; mechanics, and cover current developments of X-SGBEM.<br />

<span style=""font-size:12pt""><span>The massive datasets now commonplace in many fields of industry and science hold the promise of significantly changing our understanding of the world around us. Key to the fulfillment of this promise however, is the ability to perform computationally efficient statistical inference on such large datasets. This motivates one of the key questions in theoretical data science, to understand which statistical inference tasks are impossible, which are possible but computationally infeasible for large datasets, and which enjoy efficient estimation procedures.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span>In this talk, we will focus on an important class of estimation problems that are rich in algebraic structure. Motivated by problems in signal/image processing, and computer vision we will address the task of estimating a signal, image, tri-dimensional structure/scene from measurements corrupted not only by noise but also by latent transformations. Many such transformations can be described as a group acting on the object to be recovered. Examples include the Simulatenous Localization and Mapping (SLaM) problem in Robotics and Computer Vision, where pictures of a scene are obtained from different positions and orientations;&nbsp;Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) imaging where projections of a molecule density are taken from unknown rotations, and several others.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span>One fundamental example of this type of problems is Multi-Reference Alignment: Given a group acting in a space, the goal is to estimate an orbit of the group action from noisy samples. For example, in one of its simplest forms, one is tasked with estimating a signal from noisy cyclically shifted copies. We will show that the number of observations needed by any method has a surprising dependency on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and algebraic properties of the underlying group action. Remarkably, in some important cases, this sample complexity is achieved with computationally efficient methods based on computing invariants under the group of transformations; while in others fundamental computational bottlenecks seem to arise.</span></span><br />

<p>Consumer-driven health care is often heralded as a new quality paradigm in medicine. However, patients-as-consumers face difficulties in judging the quality of their medical treatment. With a sample of 3,000 U.S. hospitals, we find that neither medical quality nor patient survival rates have much impact on patient satisfaction with their hospital. In contrast, patients are very sensitive to the &lsquo;room and board&rsquo; aspects of care that are highly visible. Quiet rooms have a larger impact on patient satisfaction than medical quality, and communication with nurses affects satisfaction far more than the<br />
hospital-level risk of dying. Hotel experiences create a halo effect of patient goodwill, while medical excellence and patient safety do not. Moreover, when hospitals face greater competition from other hospitals, patient satisfaction is higher but medical quality is lower. Consumer-driven health care creates pressures for hospitals to be more like hotels.</p>

defining secular moral truth for an international audience (Redfield 2006: 5&ndash;6).<br />
Combining medical expression, expert knowledge, public expression, and in the<br />

example of the FBR sheds light on global networks of humanitarian<br />
organizations and their being embedded into political alliances of conservative<br />
Christians in the USA, politicians, and the US army. Finally, the example shows<br />
the important role of international NGOs and their alliances with locals in the<br />
politics of protection. Situating the FBR in a larger empirical context, I ask: how<br />
do these humanitarian health organizations shape new landscapes of<br />
humanitarian assistance and mobilization? How are the most vulnerable<br />
refugees situated in this growing field of voluntary intervention and<br />
mobilization? How does the insertion into these new assemblages situate the<br />
individual self within Christian infrastructures of humanitarian aid? Given the<br />
human rights documentation of the FBR and their accumulation of knowledge<br />

On April 20, 2010, an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon set off the largest marine oil spill in history. In the months that followed, industry professionals scrambled to stop the spill while lawyers worked to uncover the causes of this disaster. In spite of extensive media coverage, many of the spill&rsquo;s lasting human and environmental costs went unreported.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Crafted from interviews with those most intimately affected, Leigh Fondakowski&rsquo;s <i>SPILL</i> paints a striking portrait of communities indelibly altered by this disaster. Returning to this story nearly a decade after it began&nbsp;allows us to&nbsp;<br />
examine the powerful forces that not only caused the spill, but that also continue to shape how stories about environmental disasters and climate change are told.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

It investigates, through comparative study, the ways in which the socialist state aimed to reinvent domesticity and to constitute a new socialist subject&mdash;the Socialist Man and Woman&mdash; through the construction of an extensive housing infrastructure. </span><span>The domestic revolution, initiated by Khrushchev, constitutes the narrative that both Bucharest and Havana share; an archaeology of its formation reveals it as a common paradigm instituting a politics of domesticity&mdash;generated by the transition to state socialism. Their desire to establish a new ideology through the convergence of productive and domestic life by way of industrialization resulted in an ontological transformation that connected ideology, domestic infrastructure, and the subjective body. </span><span>The project argues that domestic infrastructures were constituted as the aesthetic and technological vehicle through which the body was politically inscribed and shaped. </span><span>The total project of domesticity initiated in the 1950s can thus be understood as built on the legacy of the programs of the Russian avant-gardes, and</span><span> the political formation of the body seen as an infrastructural and cognitive process that is articulated at the &lsquo;hearth&rsquo; of the home.</span></span></span></p>

They are based on Hering&rsquo;s theory of opponent color vision in which three orthogonal, opponent color channels are present: red-green, yellow-blue and white-black. Unique red and unique green are defined as hues that contain neither yellow nor blue. Unique yellow and unique blue are hues that contain neither red nor green. UHs can be determined for self-luminous or object stimuli. Unique hue data obtained under different illumination conditions allow one to test the validity of uniform color spaces such as CIELAB and CIECAM based models, which are widely used in industrial applications. Unique hues could also serve as a set of hues that should be preserved when viewed on different displays and could be useful constraints for gamut mapping algorithms. Techniques employed to determine UHs include selection of object color patches from Munsell samples and NCS color set by a group of observers over repeated trials, among other techniques.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><span style=""font-size:13.0pt"">There are various factors that influence the perception of UHs. In this presentation, we will review some of these parameters including chroma and stimulus size under various light sources that simulate specific illuminants. The presentation will include a discussion of experiments involving data collected from color-normal observers who selected samples representing uH stimuli in repeated trials. One study included two sets of high chroma chips that varied in size, one at 5.7<sup>o</sup> field of view size and the other at 1.4<sup>o</sup>. The second study involved a set of low chroma and a set of high chroma samples of the same size.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><span style=""font-size:13.0pt"">The uH responses obtained from all observers are used to calculate the frequency and mean for the selected stimuli. These frequencies represent substantial variability among observers and show variations based on illumination and viewing conditions. We have found that the mean uH responses are also significantly different based on the colorfulness of the stimuli. Variability among observers is also found to be hue dependent. These pose interesting questions about the nature of uHs and whether neuro-physiological models can be used to address their origins. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span><span style=""font-size:13.0pt"">Nonetheless, benefits of studying uHs for basic color vision research include specification of a set of salient colors in a device-independent space where results can be comparable across different laboratories. This would be similar to currently used definitions in terms of cone space as adopted by the CIE. Additionally experimental color vision research, preferentially stimulating higher-order color mechanisms may be shown to be more appropriate than employing stimuli that isolate receptoral or post-receptoral mechanisms. Regarding color management systems, these unique hues could serve as a set of colors that should be preserved when viewed on different displays and could be useful constraints for gamut mapping algorithms.</span></span></span></p>

To increase the cooling rate, Derbenev and Litvinenko proposed Coherent electron Cooling (CeC), which makes use of the large bandwidth of a Free Electron Laser to amplify the hadron signal. This talk describes an alternative CeC scheme using the microbunching instability as the amplifier.&nbsp; I will also describe a method for suppressing shot noise fluctuations in the electron beam current to further improve cooling rates.</span></span></p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration.

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><b><i>Potential vs. Realized Savings under Automatic Enrollment</i></b></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp; <span style=""font-size:12pt""><span>Employer adoption of automatic enrollment can dramatically increase retirement savings plan participation. However, many savings plan participants withdraw some, or even all, of their accumulated balances prior to reaching retirement. The extent to which individuals&rsquo; pre-retirement withdrawal decisions months or even years after they have been automatically enrolled offset the increased savings induced by automatic enrollment is an open question. We explore this issue by studying the evolution of retirement savings outcomes over time for the employees at five firms introducing automatic enrollment between 2005 and 2010. Comparing employees hired in the twelve months after the introduction of automatic enrollment to those hired in the twelve months prior, we find that automatic enrollment increases total potential retirement system balances by 3.2-17.5% of starting pay 84 months after hire; at the same time, leakage in the form of outstanding loans and withdrawals that are not rolled over into another qualified savings plan also increase by 0.9-3.8% of starting pay, offsetting between 5.3-47.3% of the potential increase in savings from automatic enrollment. The net effect is that automatic enrollment increases retirement system balances by 1.7-16.5% of first year pay 84 months after hire.</span></span></p>

<p><span>In this presentation my objectives are three-fold. First, I present a concise overview of my ethnographic research trajectory, working with Viliui Sakha communities of northeastern Siberia, Russia, starting in 1991 and to date. This provides my audience with an overview of how my anthropological investigations of change, in its many forms, evolved into both a focus on inhabitants&rsquo; perceptions, understandings and responses to the local effects of global climate change and, concomitantly, on to other drivers of change, most prominently economic globalization and intergenerational alienation. I then use examples of my research in the last decade in other cultural contexts (and including the Chesapeake Bay) to show how these drivers similarly challenge a myriad of rural communities&rsquo; sustainable futures. Second, based upon my almost thirty years of anthropological engagement described above, I clarify how, as a result, I maintain two central focal points as anthropological contributions towards transformative change: knowledge systems and narratives. After clarifying both, I provide several distinct examples of my present work in knowledge systems and narratives as anthropological contributions towards interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to issues of global change. In my third presentation portion, I take my research and teaching experiences to date to show how I can imagine these contributions in the context of both Cornell&rsquo;s Atkinson Center for Sustainability and its Anthropology Department. </span></p>

Architected materials such as cellular solids, micro- and nano-lattices, multi-phase composite structures and self-assembled nanostructures are at the core of this shift. This is due to their unique properties that are derived by their intricate architecture- a combination of topology, material distribution and base material(s) composition properties. The complex interplay of these features leads to a wide range of deformation mechanisms that include nonlinear elastic instabilities, plastic deformation and collapse, brittle fracture, and shock-type collapse. This talk will focus on our ongoing efforts to connect key morphological characteristics to the resulting material properties for three different problems: the crushing of open-cell foams, elastic wave propagation in regular and disordered cellular materials, and the mechanical properties of DNA nanostructures.</p>

The right scheduling policy can dramatically reduce response times, ensure fairness, provide class-based priority, etc., without requiring additional resources. While stochastic response time analysis of different scheduling policies has been the focus of thousands of theoretical papers, results are limited to analyzing a relatively small number of &quot;simple&quot; scheduling policies.</p>

<p>In this talk, we introduce the SOAP class of scheduling policies: Schedule Ordered by Age-based Priority. The SOAP policies include almost all scheduling policies in the literature as well as an infinite number of variants which have never been analyzed, or maybe even conceived. SOAP policies include the highly intractable SERPT policy (Shortest-Expected-Remaining-Processing-Time), as well as the famously complex Gittins Index policy. SOAP also includes all sorts of &quot;combination&quot; policies, like a policy that performs Shortest-Job-First on jobs with known size and Foreground-Background scheduling on jobs with unknown size, or a policy that is allowed to preempt jobs only when they hit certain ages. In this talk we present a stochastic response time analysis of all SOAP policies via a single universal framework. If time permits, we will also discuss some open problems in scheduling of current interest.</p>

The current business models and industrial processes, however, are being challenged by internal and external shifts such as evolving consumer values and increasing political, social, and environmental pressures. In response to these challenges, we have the opportunity to redefine the role of fashion and shift our engagement with consumers from processing a transaction to a building a community. Burak Cakmak, Dean of Fashion at Parsons, is putting the design process at the center of the reinvention of the existing system and redefining the role of the fashion designer by imbuing purpose into the new scope of their responsibilities. The conversation will explore how the Parsons School of Fashion is rethinking how fashion engages with society.</span></span></p>

Previous GSEM conferences have been held in Miami (2016), Boston (2017) and Miami (2018). This conference provides a platform to bring together like-minded senior and junior scholars, doctoral students, and practitioners in the fields of international business, strategic management, cross-cultural management, technology strategy and global entrepreneurship from around the world, with an interest on global strategy and emerging markets.</p>

<p>The theme this year is &ldquo;Institutional Complexities and Strategic Responses in the New Global Economy.&rdquo; The new global economy is at a crossroads. Forces of &ldquo;de-globalization&rdquo; are endeavoring to slow down globalization. Advances of technologies are penetrating more aspects of human life. Engines of economic growth are readjusting to the &ldquo;new normal.&rdquo; Overall, institutions as &ldquo;the rules of the game&rdquo; can no longer be viewed as static and invisible. Instead, a series of the rules of the game &mdash; ranging from national and international politics to technological standards and competition policies &mdash; are changing, and their complexities are increasing. Such institutional transitions are forcing managers and entrepreneurs to search for new, innovative strategies.</p>

<p>We welcome papers that analyze the interaction between global strategy and emerging markets, and especially those that focus on the theme of the conference: how firms led by managers and entrepreneurs eager to grow strategically respond to a new global economy with such heightened institutional complexities.</p>

<p>Examples of Related Topics</p>

<ul>
	<li>How do forces of &ldquo;de-globalization&rdquo; affect long-term strategic thinking?</li>
	<li>How do technological advances (such as the &ldquo;internet of things&rdquo; and artificial intelligence) influence entrepreneurial behavior?</li>
	<li>How do societal and environmental changes (such as global warming, migration and aging population) provoke new growth opportunities or depress such opportunities?</li>
	<li>What are the responses of firms from developed economies to changes in emerging markets?</li>
	<li>Are firms from emerging markets likely to become more or less interested in internationalization?</li>
	<li>How have U.S. firms responded to the country&rsquo;s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)? How have firms in the other TPP countries reacted to these changes?</li>
	<li>What strategies are Canadian, Mexican and U.S. firms using to cope with the uncertainties surrounding the future of NAFTA/USMCA?</li>
	<li>What scenarios of Brexit are UK firms preparing? How do firms from the rest of the EU respond?</li>
	<li>How have Chinese firms responded to the &ldquo;One Belt, One Road&rdquo; initiative? How do firms based in the &ldquo;One Belt, One Road&rdquo; zone respond?</li>
	<li>How can existing theories contribute to a better understanding of some of these important but underexplored questions? If existing theories are inadequate, how can we develop new ones?</li>
</ul>

<p>We invite you to submit complete papers (40 double-spaced pages, following&nbsp;<i>Academy of Management Journal</i>&nbsp;guidelines)&nbsp;<u>OR</u>&nbsp;proposals (5 single-spaced pages, following Strategic Management Society conference guidelines), especially from junior scholars/doctoral students.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E. Green, the Gale and Ira Drukier Curator of European and American Art, Prints &amp; Drawings, 1800&ndash;1945, at the Johnson, and supported in part by the Helen and Robert J.

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span><span>The resistance of hydropower controversy is a typical reflection of the rising environmentalism and ENGOs that have effectively utilized emerging public environmental awareness, bureaucratic fragmentation, publicness pursuing media, and the shackled knowledge-control regimes to successfully suspend nearly all targeted dams in the past 16 years, while widespread GMO controversy represents a story of how civic epistemology can challenge biotechnologists&rsquo; knowledge-control regimes and break their fragile science-politics alliance. Since 2006, China has not commercialized any GM crops. By contrast, nuclear power has shown both narrow political opportunity structure and very strong knowledge-control regimes, thanks to its lack of bureaucratic fragmentation, its historical glory and a lack of public attention. </span></span></span><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span>As a result, the debate only temporarily postponed construction of new nuclear power plants.</span></span></p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E.

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

<p>Many of the ways we use mobile and social media today have longstanding precedents in historical media like letters, diaries, scrapbooks, and home movies. What we think of as the &lsquo;social media revolution&rsquo; is part of a much longer story about the use of media for connecting people through the documenting and sharing of everyday life. Placing mobile and social media into a longer historical context helps to reveal what is really new about these contemporary communication technologies, what future services might learn from historical communication practices, and what fundamental aspects of the human experience emerge through a variety of technological platforms.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them. Mann Library has developed this exhibit in conjunction with the<a href=""https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2019/03/her-natural-history.html""> Her Natural History celebration </a>sponsored by partners of the Biodiversity Heritage Library for Women&#39;s History Month 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E. Green, the Gale and Ira Drukier Curator of European and American Art, Prints &amp; Drawings, 1800&ndash;1945, at the Johnson, and supported in part by the Helen and Robert J.

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

While contemporary historians are aware of the fiscal&nbsp;crisis in the Song dynasty, the ways in which this crisis influenced local society has yet been fully investigated. In this session, the speaker will use one example to show how local officials responded to the financial pressures from the court, and how this financial effort led to further problems in the locality. There will be an introduction focusing on the political and social context of a county, Liyang, which is in southeast China, followed by a close reading of a text about the destruction of a local cult. Together we will decipher the financial concerns in the disguise of religious problems in the local society.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Plants are monitored each year to evaluate the impact of deer browsing. AVID is a method for volunteers, foresters, landowners and others to measure the effect of deer browse on New York forests. Volunteers are encouraged to use AVID to document this aspect of New York forest health. Participants will learn about forest and woodland ecology, how to identify spring wildflowers and trees, and develop an eye for recognizing signs of deer impacts.


Individuals can use AVID by printing field data sheets and entering the data online here at this web site, or through a smart phone app available for either Apple or Android phones at Apple Store or Google Play Store. Field data collected by individuals and organizations across New York State, and submitted to this central database, will be used to track tree, shrub and wildflower response to deer browsing over time. Knowledge of how deer impacts change through time will help guide deer management decisions at local and state levels. Participants will document changes in forest plants on their own land, or land in their communities, and also will learn:


To identify important spring wildflower and tree species
To recognize evidence of deer impacts based on the presence or absence of key wildflower, shrub, and tree indicator species




Kristi Sullivan, Cornell University Department of Natural Resources and a developer of the AVID protocol will train volunteers interested in learning about this easy, rapid assessment method for evaluating deer impacts.


The training will be 9:30 am - 2 pm. A bag lunch will be served. 


Registration fee is $10 payable by cash or check at the door. There is a field component to this training session. Dress for the weather, including appropriate footwear.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Watercolors, drawings, oil sketches, and sketchbooks made by European and American artists from the 1770s to the 1890s reflect the period&rsquo;s new scientific investigation of the earth&rsquo;s crust that came to be known as geology. The intrinsic curiosity of the era&rsquo;s artists drove them to explore these new ideas in a variety of media, while interests in minerals and their applications brought wide-ranging explorations of this modern science of the earth. Artists such as Frederic Edwin Church, William Trost Richards, John Ruskin, J. M. W. Turner, and Asher Brown Durand mindfully investigated the land, taking note of exquisite and even surreal landforms in their work.</p>

<p>A selection of works from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection will accompany the exhibition and explore how this fascination continued into the twentieth century, especially in America.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was organized by the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College, where it was on view in 2018. Its presentation at Cornell was coordinated by Nancy E. Green, the Gale and Ira Drukier Curator of European and American Art, Prints &amp; Drawings, 1800&ndash;1945, at the Johnson, and supported in part by the Helen and Robert J.

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

<p>This work was&nbsp;acquired for the Johnson Museum&#39;s permanent collection through the Stern Family Contemporary Art Acquisition Fund (2018.039).</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

When the solution to a business problem or opportunity involves a software component, the solution team must determine how software will best support the business. A use case diagram clearly depicts the scope of the solution to be designed which can help set expectations for stakeholders as to the complexity and interactions with the system. This class focuses on the business analysis work of defining functional, non-functional, and transition requirements which describe the solution and roll out needs. In addition to use case modeling, this course provides guidelines for developing system and user interfaces, a checklist for non-functional requirements, and strategies for developing an implementation plan. These are critical components in fully defining your solution requirements.&nbsp;*Breakfast at 8am&nbsp;&amp; Lunch at Noon - both included*</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration.

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

When the solution to a business problem or opportunity involves a software component, the solution team must determine how software will best support the business. A use case diagram clearly depicts the scope of the solution to be designed which can help set expectations for stakeholders as to the complexity and interactions with the system. This class focuses on the business analysis work of defining functional, non-functional, and transition requirements which describe the solution and roll out needs. In addition to use case modeling, this course provides guidelines for developing system and user interfaces, a checklist for non-functional requirements, and strategies for developing an implementation plan. These are critical components in fully defining your solution requirements.&nbsp;*Breakfast at 8am&nbsp;&amp; Lunch at Noon - both included*</p>

At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

This class focuses on the business analysis work of defining functional, non-functional, and transition requirements which describe the solution and roll out needs. In addition to use case modeling, this course provides guidelines for developing system and user interfaces, a checklist for non-functional requirements, and strategies for developing an implementation plan.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration.

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection?

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Presented by: Nicole Borukhov


Fee: $20 per person 


We have trillions of microscopic organisms living in our gut and the interaction between these microflorae can have a huge impact on the human body. Research suggests a strong association between the amount and types of bacteria in our gut and chronic conditions like obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. In this workshop, we focus on methods for modulating our microflorae and how prebiotics and probiotics can keep our gut happy and healthy.

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

<p>This work was&nbsp;acquired for the Johnson Museum&#39;s permanent collection through the Stern Family Contemporary Art Acquisition Fund (2018.039).</p>

399,1541644,Traded Treasure: Indian Textiles for Global Markets,https://events.cornell.edu/event/traded_treasure_indian_textiles_for_global_markets,2019-06-09T09:00:00-04:00,"","<p>Known for many centuries as the source of fine cotton and silk textiles, India has produced some of the world&rsquo;s most innovative textile traditions. Spanning five hundred years of the history of India&rsquo;s thriving commerce to Southeast Asia, Europe, and Japan, this exhibition reveals why Indian textiles were in demand the world over.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest surviving Indian textiles are printed and painted cotton fragments found in Indonesia. Along with silk double-ikat&nbsp;<i>patola</i>, these were used for ceremonial purposes and treasured in Indonesia as heirlooms. The maritime trade that relied on supplying Indian textiles to Southeast Asian markets in exchange for spices was first conducted by Arab, Persian, and Indian merchants but later dominated by Portuguese, Dutch, and British traders, which expanded the demand for Indian chintz and embroideries in Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>The textiles presented in this exhibition, drawn from the collection of Banoo and Jeevak Parpia, tell a fascinating story of global commerce and the ingenious ways that Indian artisans designed and produced goods of astonishing beauty and technical sophistication, while also revealing how cross-cultural interchange contributed to global aesthetic developments.</p>

<p>A fully illustrated catalogue with essays by leading experts Ruth Barnes, Kaja McGowan, and Sylvia Houghteling elucidates the history of the Indian textile trade.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Ellen Avril, chief curator and curator of Asian Art, at the Johnson Museum, and supported by a generous gift endowed in memory of Elizabeth Miller Francis &rsquo;47.</i></p>

399,1541675,"Undressed: The Nude In Context, 1500-1750",https://events.cornell.edu/event/undressed_the_nude_in_context_1500-1750,2019-06-09T09:00:00-04:00,"","<p>The early years of the Renaissance brought about renewed interest in the idealized proportions and smooth and languid gestures of Greco-Roman sculptures, which became the preferred model for the then-contemporary nude figure. However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

<p>Seat of the ancient Roman Empire, home of the Catholic Church for two millennia, and vibrant capital of modern Italy, Rome offers an astonishingly rich and complex array of treasures. The Eternal City&#39;s long history has left layer upon layer of visible traces, creating astonishing and improbable juxtapositions.</p>

<p>In approaching this overwhelming wealth during our insider&#39;s tour, we&#39;ll concentrate on&mdash;but not limit ourselves to&mdash;the art, architecture, and events of the great Renaissance and Baroque phases of Rome&#39;s history.</p>

<p>On daily four-hour morning walks, we&#39;ll visit such celebrated sites as the Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, the Colosseum, and the Vatican. But we&#39;ll often follow less-traveled paths in the illuminating company of <a href=""https://www.sce.cornell.edu/cau/faculty/index.php?id=375"">Jeffrey Blanchard</a>, academic coordinator of Cornell in Rome and art and architecture historian, who has lived in the city for the past forty years.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll also spend a day in the country at such sixteenth-century villas and gardens as the Palazzo Farnese at Caprarola and Villa Lante at Bagnaia. Fully acknowledging that to appreciate Rome &quot;a lifetime would not suffice,&quot; we will nonetheless do our level best.</p>

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p>The second part of the mushroom course offerings, this course will provide practical instruction for designing and building controlled atmosphere mushroom production spaces. Learn&nbsp;the basic techniques and equipment required to start producing mushrooms on a small scale commercially. Focus will be on the importance of proper design, layout, and equipment so that profitable production can be achieved using limited space and labor.&nbsp;Recommended prerequisite: Learning to Work with Mushrooms &amp; Fungi.</p>

<p>This course will be taught by Eric Myers of Myers Mushrooms. Eric is currently serving as a Technical Sargent in the United States Air Force as a Vehicle Mechanic and has been growing mushrooms commercially at home for 4 years. In 2015 he realized the potential for gourmet mushroom production in small spaces, as well as the market demand for gourmet mushrooms to be local. This inspired him to start producing mushrooms in his garage. Eric has shared his experience and his designs via his popular YouTube channel, which has provided thousands of growers with examples oftools and methods for efficient indoor mushroom cultivation. Eric developed and refined a low-pressure single-drum sterilizer, an alternative to commercial autoclaves, which equipped small scale mushroom growers with an affordable, easy to build, commercial grade option for bulk substrate sterilization. In 2017 Eric launched his Hands-on Cultivation Class and has since been mentoring hundreds of small-scale growers across the US. Eric and his family recently relocated with the military to Haysville, KS andexpanded to a 2,400 sq/ft warehouse. This workshop will be an accelerated version of Eric&rsquo;s 2-day Hands-on Cultivation Class.</p>

<p>This workshop will be held at the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.equicenterny.org/copy-of-equicenter-farm"">EquiCenter Farm</a>, and lunch is provided.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is recommended that students arrive around 9:30 a.m. to get coffee, tea and snacks, and get checked-in and settled before the class begins.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

<p>This work was&nbsp;acquired for the Johnson Museum&#39;s permanent collection through the Stern Family Contemporary Art Acquisition Fund (2018.039).</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

This experience deeply affected her performance-based work, in which she often tests the limits of her body. Her 2017 video&nbsp;<i>La Sombra (The Shadow)</i>&nbsp;was one of three pieces that were commissioned by Documenta, one of the most important surveys of contemporary art that takes place in Kassel, Germany, every five years. Chased in the video by a Leopard tank to utter exhaustion, Galindo aims to bring attention to Germany&rsquo;s ranking among the top five weapons manufacturers in the world, pointing to the West&rsquo;s complicity in the oppression and death of millions of people across the globe.</p>

<p>In 2015 Galindo was awarded the Golden Lion for best artist under 35 in the 51st Venice Biennale. Her work is included in the collections of the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Museum, Tate Modern, and many others.</p>

<p>This work was&nbsp;acquired for the Johnson Museum&#39;s permanent collection through the Stern Family Contemporary Art Acquisition Fund (2018.039).</p>

However, as the study of the human body using cadavers, &eacute;corch&eacute; figures, and live models became increasingly popular, artists fused this focused attention on musculature and anatomical features with the vogue for classical idealism.</p>

<p>This exhibition, drawn from the Johnson&rsquo;s permanent collection, public institutions, and private collectors, will examine the trajectory of the nude body in art. It will explore how the nude is defined, both artistically and circumstantially, as the idea of the Renaissance ideal evolved over both time and space, raising questions about what bodies are allowed to be shown nude, how the body expresses gender and beauty, and how the nude is used to express narrative content and heightened emotion. How does the practice of working from studio models change what bodies are shown nude? How does a rising interest in anatomical accuracy reaffirm or chafe against conceptions of classical perfection? How does the nude body change from religious painting to mythological subjects? Undressed will examine these questions and more through paintings, prints, drawings, and anatomy books.</p>

<p><i>This exhibition was curated by Andrew Weislogel, the Seymour R. Askin, Jr. &rsquo;47 Curator, Earlier European and American Art, and Brittany Rubin, print room curatorial assistant, at the Johnson Museum, and supported in part by the Donald and Maria Cox Exhibition Endowment.</i></p>

introductory course to discuss statistical methods and where they may be employed<br />
in a processing operation. The SQF Quality Code requires certified companies to be<br />
competent in SPC to reduce process variation and drive root cause analysis.<br />
Under the SQF Quality Code, a quality management system must include SPC<br />
methods which shall be employed to improve process efficiency and product quality.<br />
The code also requires that SPC training is provided to line operators, quality<br />
inspectors, and supervisory staff.</p>

<p><br />
The course consists of lecture sessions that will cover basic data handling and<br />
analysis, sampling methods and date collection, interpreting averages, distribution<br />
and variation, control charts, and process capability.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

<p>Artist Nicholas Mino will lead this captivating exploration of screen printing, an art form that dates to tenth-century China. He will introduce us to screen printing&#39;s most popular historical uses&mdash;movie posters and political agita art&mdash;and its best-known practitioners, none more famous than Andy Warhol for his depictions of Marilyn Monroe and Campbell&#39;s soup cans.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll spend the greater part of our time, however, creating screen prints ourselves. Nicholas will guide us step by step through the process of developing single- and multi-color works of art. Applicable to posters, shirts, tote bags, record albums, flyers, and advertising materials, screen printing is arguably the most versatile&mdash;and fun&mdash;form of art production.

Michele&#39;s thoughtful lectures will give you a foundational understanding of design concepts, while field trips to the Cornell Botanic Gardens and other notable grounds will give you opportunities to analyze landscape challenges and constraints.

<p>Guiding us&mdash;beginner and experienced chefs alike&mdash;will be Dave D&#39;Aprix, Culinary Institute of America graduate, local caterer, and former Cornell Hotel School instructor. Rather than relying exclusively on recipes, David will emphasize cooking techniques and the value of a well-stocked larder for making gourmet dishes with little advanced planning.

<p>When Oscar Fingal O&#39;Flahertie Wills Wilde (1854-1900) left colonial Dublin to take metropolitan England by storm, he established himself as one of the funniest, most consequential figures in literary history.</p>

<p>At Oxford, he was a disciple of the Aestheticism/Decadence movement fostered by fellow intellectuals and artists who promoted &quot;art for art&#39;s sake,&quot; a stance swiftly parodied by the establishment. By the early 1890s, Wilde became famous for his epigrammatic wit, wildly popular novels, and plays brimming with social satire.</p>

<p>As a trailblazer for gay liberation, Wilde&#39;s 1895 trial and conviction for sodomy helped to create twentieth-century gay identity, the &quot;love that dared not speak its name.&quot; It can be argued that Wilde&#39;s own life, though it ended tragically, was his greatest work of art. We&#39;ll visit some of Cornell&#39;s rich literature collections and read The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) and other writings, including Wilde&#39;s dramatic masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest (1895).</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways.

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Judging will take place here at CCE Oneida, in Oriskany


If you enjoy working with youth and have an interest in encouraging the efforts of 4-H Members, I encourage you to register as a Volunteer Evaluator.  Judges will earn $50 which can be donated back to the 4-H Department if so desired*.


Youth may submit in the following areas:



Communications and Expressive Arts- Posters, Scrapbooks, Banners......
Arts and Crafts
Clothing and Textiles
Home Furnishings- Furniture, Pillows, Wall Hangings........
Visual Arts-Photography, Video, PowerPoint.....
Natural Resources-Wildlife, Recycling.......
Entomology
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)
Geo Spatial, Rockets
Woodworking
Gardening
Food

All youth submitting projects to the fair must have a face to face evaluation with a judge (that's you).  Youth will bring you a project.  You discuss the project with youth asking questions like: ""What did you learn? Where did you get the idea? What would you do different?""  After meeting with the youth you will complete an evaluation form.  Give the project to a youth helper and note if you think the project is good enough to be sent on to the State Fair.


Youth wishing to register as Assistants will be responsible for taking projects to and from the judges. Setting up and breaking down tables.  Packing up supplies.


Adult volunteers are needed to work the scoring and ribbon tables.


Judges should plan on arriving at 5pm at CCE Oneida.  We will serve a light supper, wraps, chips and drinks.  At 5:15 we will hold judges orientation and judging will start at 5:30pm


Youth assistants and other volunteers should plan on arriving at 4:30pm to assist with set up and organizing the event. Supper will be provided at 5pm wraps, chips and drinks.


Youth submitting projects, will be arriving between 5:30 and 6:30pm.  Once all projects have been evaluated judges will be released.  I expect everyone will be finished by 8pm.


Thanks to those individuals that donated the $50 back to Oneida County 4-H last year.  Because of you we were able to create several opportunities for 4-H Youth to express and challenge their creativity.  Your donation allowed us to provide the supplies for the Art in the Bucket Challenge, Horse and Cow Cut-outs.  I hope you will all have the ability to meet and evaluate the youth that your donation supported."

Event date: July 17, 2019


Registration deadline: Jul 1, 2019


REMEMBER: Every 4-H Member wishing to show an animal or project at the Boonville Oneida County Fair must have logged in 6 hours of Community Service. Cloverbuds excluded. https://reg.cce.cornell.edu/Facesof4H2017-18_230


All 4-H Members are encouraged to submit projects for public view at the Boonville Fair. In an effort to reduce paperwork for everyone. ALL projects that are to be displayed in the Youth Building must be pre-registered. Projects not pre-registered by July 1st will not be accepted for display or awards.


The pre registration information supplied will enable us to determine how many judges and in what categories they are needed.


Please remember you are limited to entering 12 items in the youth building. Please make sure they are your BEST work.


Pre-registration will also allow us to print out the Exhibitor's Cards ( Eliminating the need for you to hand write them)

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

<p>&quot;Humor must not professedly teach, and it must not professedly preach, but it must do both if it would live forever.&quot; So said Mark Twain. In this class, we&#39;ll try to define the American sense of humor.</p>

<p>Among a wealth of sources, we&#39;ll look at the frontier humor of Twain; analyze Charlie Chaplin&#39;s tramp and vaudeville&#39;s appeal to immigrants; consider American romantic comedies and TV sitcoms; and discuss Woody Allen&#39;s distinctive brand of humor. We&#39;ll also consider American political satire from George Carlin to P. J. O&#39;Rourke, Jon Stewart, and Stephen Colbert. Our earnest (and occasionally less than earnest) efforts to characterize American humor will be led by no less a wit than Glenn C. Altschuler, the Thomas and Dorothy Litwin Professor of American Studies.</p>

<p>Does God exist? Do humans have free will? And most important, how can we truly be happy? We&#39;ll discuss these and other big philosophical questions as classicist Michael Fontaine leads us through&nbsp;<i>On the Nature of Things (De Rerum Natura)</i>&nbsp;by the first-century BCE Roman poet Lucretius, who wrote some of the finest Latin verses from the ancient world.</p>

<p>As an apostle of Greek philosopher Epicurus, Lucretius based his work on his mentor&#39;s ancient study of atomism, a precursor to today&#39;s atomic theory. Epicureanism contends that the world is made of matter created by natural, not supernatural, laws, that there is no afterlife, that happiness is the highest human goal, and that humans are capable of morality and self-fulfillment without gods. This secular philosophy dominated the ancient world for centuries until it was knocked off its throne by Christianity. We&#39;ll also find out which American founding father quietly subscribed to Epicurean thought.</p>

A new exhibit at Mann Library showcases the results of a multi-year collaboration between the lab of Cornell entomology professor&nbsp;Scott McArt and Welsh artists, who cross national and disciplinary boundaries to celebrate the beauty and importance of pollinators, and reveal how their fate is linked to our planet, and to our own.</p>

<p>Originally developed as a pioneering Arts and Humanities Research Council funded Networking project in Wales called <a href=""https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/""><i>Cross-Pollination: Revaluing Pollinators through Arts and Science Collaboration</i>,</a>&nbsp;this project has brought artists and scientists together on two continents to explore and promote the world-wide crisis facing pollinators. <i>Cross-Pollination</i> was led by the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in partnership with Aberystwyth University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Additional funding was provided by the Arts Council of Wales to enhance the art-work production and to increase the impact of the project, and Wales Arts International to help fund the exhibit in Mann Library.</p>

Yet while men received the credit and fame for advances in knowledge, women, too, contributed in significant, if generally unheralded, ways. Trained in art and pushed toward &ldquo;more delicate pursuits,&rdquo; many women provided the illustrations of plants that made the botanical texts of the 18th and 19th centuries the vivid, beautiful, and scientifically accurate works that they are. &nbsp;Sadly, a significant portion of these talented women have had the details of their lives lost to time, despite creating work both meaningful and important to the field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an eye towards bringing some of these hidden pioneers of science into the spotlight, <i>Unturned Leaves: Early Women in Botanical Illustration </i>showcases the achievements of several &nbsp;pre-20th century women who drew and painted plants and fungi, sometimes&nbsp;in support of&nbsp;the seminal works of their day, and sometimes primarily in support of their own personal&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to document and understand the natural world around them. Mann Library has developed this exhibit in conjunction with the<a href=""https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2019/03/her-natural-history.html""> Her Natural History celebration </a>sponsored by partners of the Biodiversity Heritage Library for Women&#39;s History Month 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing labor and civil rights as twin pillars of social reform, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. worked tirelessly to advocate for working people, create connections with labor leaders and union members, play key roles in pivotal strikes, and fight for economic justice on several fronts. He believed strongly in the labor movement asserting that &ldquo;organized labor has been one of the deterrents of human exploitation throughout its long history in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The exhibit will highlight Dr. King&rsquo;s involvement with unions spanning from the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and the organizing campaigns with his &ldquo;favorite union&rdquo; Local 1199, the National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees, to the mourning of labor after his last campaign with Sanitation Workers in Memphis and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s role in becoming the face of the hospital worker movement less than a year after his passing.</p>

<p>The exhibit will include correspondence between King and labor leaders, speeches, an audio recording from King&rsquo;s final public appearance in New York City, archival footage of hospital workers striking, vinyl recordings of King&rsquo;s speeches to unions, fliers and advertisements highlighting King&rsquo;s support of labor, union ephemera, and countless photographs of MLK and Coretta Scott King&rsquo;s work with unions and the labor movement.</p>

Johnson Museum of Art, this exhibition examines how published travel imagery created and transmitted geographical knowledge during the nineteenth century, a period of rapid and extraordinary change in how people travelled, represented, and understood the world. After photography&rsquo;s 1839 debut, the new medium was seen as uniquely suited to the task of presenting accurate geographical description. At the same time, traditional&nbsp;illustration methods such as wood engravings, etchings, and lithographs offered varied and often romanticized interpretations of their subjects in an exploding number of publications dedicated to travel and exploration. What does this reveal about the roles of authenticity and aesthetics in the success of the Western project to teach audiences about faraway places?</span></span></span></p>

	<li><b>Release the Beasts: Care and handling of your biocontrol beneficials</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=""https://entomology.cals.cornell.edu/people/john-sanderson/"">John Sanderson</a>, Department of Entomology, Cornell University. How can you ensure that the beneficials work their best? Learn how to avoid making mistakes in how you release and manage beneficial organisms to maximize the cost-effectiveness of your investment. Learn best practices for receiving shipments and storing a variety of beneficials (and which ones should not be stored), and how to release them into your greenhouse.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Growing in the Gutter: Hydroponic leafy greens and herbs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=""https://hort.cals.cornell.edu/people/neil-mattson/"">Neil Mattson</a>, Horticulture Section, Cornell University. Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) is a common hydroponic technique for growing leafy greens and herbs. This session will cover monitoring pH and EC for hydroponic crops. We&rsquo;ll also discuss abiotic disorders and common pest and disease problems. We will discuss control strategies for problems including environmental management, beneficial insects, and bio pesticides. Even if you don&rsquo;t grow hydroponically, the session will be useful for container growers of herbs and other edibles.<br />

<p>&quot;The point of theater is transformation: to make an extraordinary event of ordinary material right in front of an audience&#39;s eyes,&quot; says English playwright Lee Hall. We will explore five such transformations during CAU&#39;s sixteenth journey to the perennially exciting London stage, with its varied and riveting productions.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll enjoy plays in the West End and at the Royal National Theatre, framed by illuminating pre-performance lectures and post-performance discussions led by <a href=""https://www.sce.cornell.edu/cau/faculty/index.php?id=91"">David Feldshuh</a> and <a href=""https://www.sce.cornell.edu/cau/faculty/index.php?id=89"">Glenn Altschuler</a> (who will select the plays this winter). Enriching our visit, we will meet with a British actor from one of our productions and take a fascinating tour of the West End.</p>

<p>A practicing director, actor, and playwright, David will focus our attention on the theatrical possibilities and challenges of each production, while Glenn will emphasize the themes and contexts of the plays. Together, they will help us explore the imaginative process involved in transforming the written script of each play into a dynamic theatrical experience.</p>

Wittig&rsquo;s legacy, both literary and conceptual, does not reflect her work&rsquo;s boldness and significance. This is due in part to the way Wittig has been cleaved in two, her literary production cut off from her critical, theoretical production. Her reception in the American academy tends toward the latter: amplified by Judith Butler&rsquo;s account of Wittig in&nbsp;<i>Gender Trouble&nbsp;</i>(1990),&nbsp;<i>The Straight Mind&nbsp;</i>(1992)<i>&nbsp;</i>has had considerable traction as a work of feminist theory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In &ldquo;Monique Wittig&rsquo;s Labors,&rdquo; I put Wittig the writer and Wittig the theorist back together. I demonstrate how for Wittig, these two strands of production are coextensive. Wittig always insisted on her identity as a writer, first and foremost, because of the way literature reveals language&rsquo;s materiality in a way that purely critical writing cannot, bringing our body and language&rsquo;s into a&nbsp;<i>corps-&agrave;-corps</i>. This revelation calls on us as readers to assume a writerly relation to language and engage in the difficult labor that a writerly writer does of working with this material that is as resistant as it is malleable.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll explore medieval towns and castles, Renaissance palaces, Baroque opera houses, and vibrant vineyards along the Main River cycling path. As we take in Franconia&#39;s beautiful rolling hills, adorned with fantasy castles and charming timber-frame houses, Michael, who co-teaches a popular wine culture course at Cornell, will talk to us about the region&#39;s noteworthy viticulture dating back to Roman times.</p>

<p>Cultural highlights of our journey&mdash;expertly annotated with Michael&#39;s insights on the region&#39;s history&mdash;will include visits to such sites as Rothenberg, with its Medieval Criminal Museum, and Wurzburg, home to the extraordinary Residence palace&mdash;one of the finest in Europe.</p>

<p>We will also investigate the contradictions of Bamberg, a storybook town that escaped bombing during World War II, but harbors a dark history as the place where nearly a thousand people perished during its witch trials of the 1600s.</p>

<p>Another excursion will bring us to the architectural wonders of Bayreuth, with its opulent opera house and extraordinary Hermitage Castle.</p>

<p>Ciclismo Classico, our superb tour operator, will provide our bicycles, expert local guides, comfortable accommodations, excellent food and wine, visits to vineyards during the harvest season, and an exhilarating and memorable experience. Riders up!</p>

<p>Outside Geneva, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, is home to the world&#39;s most powerful particle accelerator&mdash;the Large Hadron Collider.</p>

<p>Every several years the collider is shut down for enhancements and visitors are allowed underground. We will take advantage of the 2019 shutdown to descend five stories into the heart of Atlas, largest of the four detectors at CERN, for a close-up view of the most sophisticated piece of scientific equipment in the history of mankind.</p>

<p>While in Switzerland, we will learn about the dawn of modern physics and Albert Einstein&#39;s work, especially in Bern, where he developed his Theory of Relativity, which revolutionized the way we think about space and time today and culminated in the greatest engineering project of all time, the LHC.</p>

<p>One of our two faculty leaders for this rare and wonderful opportunity, is Cornell physicist <a href=""https://www.sce.cornell.edu/cau/faculty/index.php?id=467"">Julia Thom-Levy</a>, who, with her Cornell research team, is currently designing and constructing a silicon pixel detector to be flown to CERN for the Large Hadron Collider upgrade.</p>

<p>Our second leader is physicist <a href=""https://www.sce.cornell.edu/cau/faculty/index.php?id=468"">Stephen Levy</a>, who has done groundbreaking work in experimental particle physics at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.</p>

<p>In addition, we&#39;ll also visit art museums to see works of Swiss artists, including those of Paul Klee, son of Bern. Along the way, we&#39;ll explore Chillon Castle and relish a variety of Swiss delights, from fondue to chocolate to delicious Swiss wines.</p>

In many settings, users can more easily and accurately respond to preference queries reflecting their current, or recently experienced, context (e.g., state of the environment), than those reflecting contexts further removed. We develop and study a formal model of experiential elicitation (EE) in which query costs and response noise are state-dependent. EE settings tightly couple the problems of control and elicitation. We provide some analysis of this abstract model, and illustrate its applicability in household heating/cooling management. We propose the use of relative value queries, asking the user to compare the immediate utility of two states, whose difficulty is related to the degree and recency of a user&rsquo;s experience with those states. We develop a Gaussian process-based approach for modeling user preferences in dynamic EE domains and show that it accrues higher reward than several natural baselines.<br />

On a jungle boat expedition, we&#39;ll close in on river otters, caiman, and poison dart frogs and disembark to observe three-toed sloths, river turtles, toucans, and parrots.</p>

<p>En route to the Manuel Antonio National Park on the Pacific, we&#39;ll zipline, swing, and rappel through the forest canopy. At the park, we&#39;ll savor our accommodations at the luxurious Hotel Parador Resort and Spa, with its self-guided garden and wildlife trails and dance parties for all ages. We&#39;ll walk, swim, snorkel, and maybe even learn to surf. Before parting, we&#39;ll also stop for an outrigger canoe trip.</p>

The cost is $15.  Celebrate St. Paddy’s Day this year with your own homemade corned beef and Irish soda bread!


At the workshop we will show you how to “corn” your own beef (or venison) to use in the traditional corned beef and cabbage recipe.  You will also learn how to make Irish soda bread.  Cornell Cooperative Extension of Seneca County’s Nutrition Issue Leader, Moira Tidball, along with Nutrition Educator, Candace Riegel, will lead the workshop.  Participants will be served a bowl of corned beef and cabbage and will go home with recipes and materials to confidently prepare this Irish fare at home."
