1,1824197,Twin Peaks,https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1824197?utm_medium=api,$16.00 - $18.00,2019-05-02 19:00:00,"Give Twin Peaks an inch and they'll take a stretch of the road. Having careened across America and beyond, sharing their staggering energy, the band made their third album the best way they know how: by themselves. The same group that produced the scuzzy squalor of their debut 'Sunken' and had legions of fans screaming along to their anthemic sophomore effort, 'Wild Onion,' now swings and serenades with 'Down In Heaven' (out on Grand Jury on May 13, 2016).

Co-produced by the band and longtime collaborator R. Andrew Humphrey, and mixed by new confidant John Agnello (Dinosaur Jr., Kurt Vile, Sonic Youth), the record is by turns raw, polished and wise beyond its years. The diverse new songs beg the listener to sway slowly, bang their head wildly and question what they were doing wasting emotional time on anything less. It is a marked, and some may say mature, development for a band that doesn't know how to play it safe. They aren't here to tell you what youth is like or what being a little older now means, though; they want to join you in a conversation about why we hurt, love and tug at each other.

While Twin Peaks is a bit older, they're not necessarily calmer; their restlessness endures. Born of Chicago's league-leading DIY scene and with several of them remaining friends since elementary school, Cadien Lake James, Clay Frankel, Connor Brodner, Jack Dolan, and most recent addition Colin Croom share an enthusiasm, authenticity and passion their audiences have found contagious. In the three years since dropping out of college to support their debut album 'Sunken,' the band has covered a lot of ground. They've played to ever-increasing crowds, bigger and rowdier each time they come barreling into a city; they were anointed ""Best New Band"" by NME and countless other blogs, and they have performed for (and partied with) more than hospitable masses at festivals in the states and Europe, including Pitchfork, Lollapalooza, Reading & Leeds, and Roskilde. In between all this action, the group set up camp in the summer of 2015 amidst the solitude of a murky lake in Western Massachusetts, where they could experiment and record on their own terms in the warm living room of a good friend's house.

Recording on reel-to-reel with the band learning studio tricks on the fly, Twin Peaks set out to a make an LP that reflects how far they've come and how much of life is left, trusting themselves to make a record they'd want to hear. James explains, ""I've been particularly drawn to records that have a more personal feel, not necessarily lyrically, but in sonic aesthetic, like The Kinks' 'Village Green Society,' Beatles' 'White Album,' and Rolling Stones' 'Beggars Banquet.' We wanted to make a record that employed the restraints of our favorite artists from yesteryear. It was about trying to simplify and hone in on the things that are important to our music and ethos."" In considering the development of the band's sound from 'Sunken' to 'Wild Onion' and now to 'Down in Heaven,' Frankel adds, ""The bands we admire are the ones who change drastically over the course of their span, like The Velvet Underground, where no two records of theirs sound the same.""

Whether sneering or pleading, aggressive or impatient, the thirteen tracks of 'Down In Heaven' are a continuation of the bands path and an eschewing of previous comparisons. It is a record all about feel: heartbreak, forgiveness, anger, jubilation, re-invention, growth. Album opener ""Walk To The One You Love,"" written by James about letting someone close to you go is immediately followed by Frankel's song ""Wanted You,"" with lyrics about not getting the one that you yearn for. With ""Stain,"" perhaps the biggest departure for the band on the record, Frankel says, ""I didn't want another love song, so after a while I got what it is, how you suffer for your art but you put up with it because you don't wanna do anything else. It's a song about the love of music."" Even though four of the five members contribute lyrics, there are obvious connections both thematically and musically across the record and the band's voice rises unified.

'Down in Heaven' will bring old fans and new Twin Peaks most complex record to date, encompassing elements only teased on their previous efforts. Frankel says, ""I don't know yet what kind of band we are, since we keep changing with every year. I guess we are a band unafraid of new influences and changes."" Put simply, 'Down In Heaven' makes it increasingly hard to call their sound ""classic."" It's rock new and old, it's a little bit of country, it's a whole lot of punk attitude, and it's something to get excited about. Twin Peaks is here to stay, and they aren't going to get pinned down."
1,1824884,The Drums,https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1824884?utm_medium=api,$16.00 - $20.00,2019-05-03 19:00:00,"On Brutalism, the fifth LP from The Drums a lot is different. It is quite possibly the best collection of songs in the band's ten-year career. The album is defined by growth, transformation and questions, but It doesn't provide all the answers. Brutalism is a form of simplistic architecture defined by blocks of raw concrete. Brutalism is rooted in an emotional rawness but its layers are soft, intricate and warm, full of frivolous and exquisitely crafted pop songs that blast sunlight and high energy in the face of anxiety, solitude and crippling self-doubt. In 2017, The Drums put out its first record as a solo project. Abysmal Thoughts belonged to Jonny Pierce alone. It discussed his painful divorce. Since, he has returned to New York and now lives between there and LA. “I felt my work in LA was done. I was exhausted, depleted and sabotaging myself, partying so much but in reality running away from pain. It was a downward spiral.” He wanted to deal with unresolved facets of his relationship with himself so he did therapy. “It was do or die,” he says. “Figuring out what it is that makes me happy, and acknowledging that I deal with depression.” He looks at Brutalism as an extension of self-care. “In order to take care of yourself you have to ask questions. Those are the things I needed to confront. It's interesting talking about the past, dealing with things that are long overdue. I'm delivering something unsure and unclear.” Even the fact that Brutalism sounds intentional, focused and efficient is a symbol of how Pierce's prioritizing of his own health and wellbeing has bled into how he makes music. For the making of this album, between his lake house in Upstate New York and a studio in Stinson Beach, California, Pierce was more open than ever, keeping his control freakery at bay, working with others to produce and record the album. He brought in Chris Coady (Beach House, Future Islands, Amen Dunes) to mix it.  If there was a guitar part he wanted to write but couldn't play, he brought in a guitarist. It's also the first Drums record with a live drummer. Delegating freed up Pierce's time to produce a more specific vision.His intentions were rooted in pop, as they've always been. Back in The Drums' previous iterations, however, the pressure was on Pierce to maintain the innocent and nostalgic sound of this surf-pop indie band and it didn't allow him to explore sex, drug use, darker emotions or how he felt currently. Abysmal Thoughts was the first occasion he had chance to do that. Lyrically Brutalism is another giant step in that direction. It's much more cut-throat. “I think there's a parental advisory sticker on the cover!” laughs Pierce. “I didn't have the courage to stand up for what I wanted before. I felt I had to keep things whimsical and that's not who I am. It feels empty.” Sonically he had been devoid of external influences, so afraid of being accused of losing the purism of The Drums' sound. Now he's rediscovering music: everything from SOPHIE to 90s band Whale. They inspired the loop-based, breakbeat drums on 'Kiss It Away' and 'Body Chemistry'. “I used to think our songs sounded like they were held together by scotch tape. These are more bulletproof.” Every track on the album is a standout. 'Body Chemistry' is the most infectious, a song about learning how to not escape in other people. “I think you can't be intelligent and not be a little bit sad,” says Pierce, of his own permanent rain cloud above his head. '626 Bedford Avenue' does what the best pop songs do: it alerts the nostalgia cog in your brain. It's a familiar melody that you think you've heard before, which works given the context of looking back on a specific time and place. 'Brutalism' is about a love so intense you feel destroyed by it. Pierce tends to find himself loving in a very extreme way that's almost harmful. 'Loner' documents the painful process of healing. “I don't want to be alone and I am scared of all the people in the world,” he sings about not knowing how to socialize. A reassuring thing has been in rediscovering that Pierce was building a community in the intricate relationships he has with listeners. Now that he's alone in this project it's even more apparent. “That's the one thing that's kept me going through this,” he says. Brutalism is defined by vulnerability. It is truly pop at its core with thoroughly modern production. “I love pop but I feel that there's a sensitivity that's missing,” he says of the landscape. Pierce wants to sacrifice ego in favor of tenderness. “I wanted to make a pop record where I'm not declaring how great I am,” he laughs. “I'm questioning if I could ever be great? I'm a grown man saying: ' I feel more crazy than ever. I feel lost. I'm terrified of the future.'” With 'Blip Of Joy' he ends on a note of hope. “I hope that one day I won't deal with depression, that I can love 
in a way that doesn't feel scary,” he says. That's why you can dance to Brutalism and you can laugh to it too. Even though it's heavy. In many The Drums has always belonged to Pierce, but it wasn't until 2016 that he reclaimed ownership. Back in 2008 Pierce and his childhood best friend Jacob Graham conceived of a collaboration that was never intended to become what it did. “Jacob and I were writing pop songs. I didn't think anybody would hear it. I recorded it with broken equipment and guitars that were out of tune.” Pierce put it on MySpace and weeks later interest was lining up. “I scrambled and found the first people I could to turn it into a band.” The runaway train lasted four albums. Pierce never felt he belonged. “Sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and hanging with my buds doesn't resonate with me. I never found community in that,” he says. “I was so terrified that if I hit the brakes even for a second everything would fall apart. I was trapped with a sound I wasn't crazy about, stuck in a culture I didn't connect with. I'm finally in my mid 30s starting to take care of myself.” The past year has been transformative. “I don't think I'll ever really find myself,” he adds. “I don't think people do. I don't think there's a day that you wake up and you go, Now I know who I am. The best way for me to be an artist is by taking a goddamn minute, being still and listening to what it is that I want and need.” It was a real year of growth for him, but growth towards what? “I don't really know, and that's OK.”"
1,1828790,Colter Wall,https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1828790?utm_medium=api,$20.00 - $25.00,2019-05-04 19:00:00,"After two years of relentless touring, Colter Wall wanted to make an album about home. Drawing on the stories of Saskatchewan, Canada, the young songwriter’s corner of the world takes shape throughout his second full-length album, Songs of the Plains. Produced by Dave Cobb in Nashville’s Studio A, the project combines striking original folk songs, well-chosen outside cuts, and a couple of traditional songs that reflect his roots growing up in the small city of Swift Current.

“One thing I’ve noticed over the last few years, in the United States and playing in Europe, is that people all over the world really don’t know much about Canada at all,” he says. “When you talk about Saskatchewan, people really have no idea. Part of it is because there are so few people there. It’s an empty place—it makes sense that people don’t know much about it. But that’s my home, so naturally I’m passionate about it. With this record, I really wanted people to look at our Western heritage and our culture.”

Indeed, Wall captures the spaciousness of the Canadian plains by relying on minimal production and his resonant baritone, which he’s strengthened into a mighty instrument in its own right. It’s a deep and knowing voice you wouldn’t expect of a man who’s not yet 24 years old.

Songs of the Plains begins with “Plain to See Plainsman,” a sincere portrait of a man whose rural heritage follows him into the greater world. As Wall lists the kinds of people he meets on the road – beautiful women, bikers, junkies, hippies—it’s easy to imagine the autobiographical component. The darkly comical “Saskatchewan in 1881” recalls a stubborn encounter between a Toronto businessman and a steadfast farmer who cultivates the province’s land. And although Wall racked up a body count on his prior album, this time he stops just short of killing the title character in “John Beyers (Camaro Song),” which he says is inspired by true events.

Evoking the most remote reaches of the plains, “Wild Dogs” sounds like a cinematic Colter Wall composition, but he actually first heard the song in Little Rock, Arkansas. Wall had just finished soundcheck in the fried chicken restaurant where he had a gig, when his buddy Ron Helm (nephew of Levon Helm) dropped in with Billy Don Burns, an esteemed songwriter who’s had cuts with many of the country legends of the 1970s. Burns wanted to pitch a few songs, and since the restaurant didn’t have a green room, Wall crawled into Burns’ backseat to listen. He found himself captivated by “Wild Dogs,” which has a minor-chord progression, no rhyme scheme, and the unique perspective of being told from the dog’s point of view.

As a folk singer, Wall places equal importance on crafting songs as well as carrying older songs into the present day. “To me, a folk singer is somebody who sings folk songs—and it’s also someone who is writing their own music, while taking something from traditional folk songs. It’s somebody who sings those songs and is aware of passing down the traditions, whether it’s from their own version of the song or taking those old tunes and reinventing them.”

That sense of tradition is part of the reason he recorded Canadian folk hero Wilf Carter’s “Calgary Round-Up,” a snapshot of the iconic Calgary Stampede. Wall considers that annual event a cornerstone of Western Canadian culture because it pulls in families from the whole region. Besides that, he says, “I wanted to have a rodeo song and that one seemed to be perfect.”

To make it his own, he put a Western Swing feel to it and brought in steel guitarist Lloyd Green and harmonica player Mickey Raphael. The Songs of the Plains sessions also featured Chris Powell on drums and Jason Simpson on bass, with Colter and Cobb sharing acoustic guitar duty.

Through his favorite folk singer, Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, Wall discovered “Night Herding Song.” Because the song was a cappella, and because Wall doesn’t wear headphones when he records, he couldn’t nail down the campfire vibe inside the sprawling Studio A. So, for this track only, he went to Dave Cobb’s house, started a fire in the outdoor fireplace, and recorded it on the spot. The immediacy of his voice is unmistakable.

Wall says he spent the last three or four years trying to get better as a singer. By putting in the work, his range is now far more dynamic and expressive. He describes the vocal development as “less gravel, without losing the baritone that I’ve developed over the years.”

Meanwhile, Wall’s ability as a songwriter is especially clear in the second half of Songs of the Plains. “Wild Bill Hickok” distills that legendary gunfighter’s epic life and death into less than three minutes. Asked about inspiration for the song, Wall cites the HBO series Deadwood, as well as Tex Ritter’s “Sam Bass” from the cowboy singer’s 1960 album, Blood on the Saddle.

While “The Trains Are Gone” laments the loss of an era, “Thinkin’ on a Woman” hints at a heartbreak as a truck driver concocts a lethal combination of whiskey, wine, and a mountain road. Wall turns far more introspective on “Manitoba Man,” a devastating song he wrote about a dark period in his life. The desperation in that track quickly gives way to the outrageous traditional song, “Tying Knots in the Devil’s Tail,” featuring verses from Blake Berglund and Corb Lund, spoons by Chris Powell, and a weird bottle of tequila by Dave Cobb.

“I went into the studio and knew exactly the story I wanted to tell,” Colter says of Songs of the Plains. “That made it easier on a sonic level and a musical level, to be able to tell Dave that it’s a record about my home. That changes it at the roots level because it’s like having a mission statement, saying, ‘All right, let’s make a Western album.’”"
1,1830562,(Sandy) Alex G,https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1830562?utm_medium=api,$16.00 - $18.00,2019-05-05 19:00:00,"At the end of “Poison Root,” the opening track on Alex Giannascoli’s new album, Rocket, the 23-year-old artist repeats the phrase “Now, I know everything” again and again, his voice seething over a clatter of banjo, violin, and acoustic guitar sounds. It’s difficult to ascertain the exact tone: does he really think he knows everything? Or are these incantations a form of self-assurance, covering up insecurity? The tension between ambition and self-doubt in this closing refrain is typical of Rocket’s fourteen tracks. Over musical backdrops that effortlessly jump from sound collage to country pop to dreamy folk music, the cast of characters that Alex G inhabits have fun, fall in love, develop obsessions, get into trouble, and burn out. Rocketillustrates a cohesive vision of contemporary experience that’s dark and foreboding, perhaps especiallybecause of how familiar, or to use Alex’s word, “unassuming,” the settings are.With a goat-adorned cover painted by Alex’s sister, Rachel, Rocket is the Philadelphia-based artist’s eighth full-length release—an assured statement that follows a slate of humble masterpieces, many of them self-recorded and self-released, stretching from 2010’s RACEto his 2015 Domino debut, Beach Music. Rocket’s sessions began shortly afterBeach Music’s ended, with Alex tracking songs at home, by himself and with friends, in the gaps between a hectic 2015 and 2016 touring schedule. Both albums were mixed by Jacob Portrait (Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Bass Drum of Death), who lent them a fine-tuning that retains the homespun personality of earlier efforts.Amid the process, in the fall of 2016, Alex made headlines for reasons outside his own releases. He had caught the attention of Frank Ocean, who asked him to play guitar on his two 2016 albums, Endless and Blonde. More than any stylistic cues, what Alex took from the experience was a newfound confidence in collaboration. “I always have a hard time letting people play on my stuff,” he says, “but I saw how comfortable [Ocean] was using other people’s playing.” Alex’s previous albums are largely solo affairs, but Rocket wears this collaborative spirit proudly. Touring band members Samuel Acchione and John Heywood contribute guitar and bass, both soloing on “County”; Samuel’s brother Colin plays bass on two songs as well. Emily Yacina, a more frequent collaborator, sings on “Bobby” and “Alina,” and Molly Germer shows up throughout the album on violin and vocals. Germer’s violin was a game-changer, as the instrument “added a texture that I can’t get on my own,” Alex notes.The looser, collaborative approach helped cultivate the variety of musical styles that Rocket presents. The dense, folky cluster of “Poison Root” leads to the bouncing country-rock of “Proud,” which is followed by the sophisticated harmonies of jazz-pop tune “County.” Later, the freaky, frantic “Witch” unsettles the album’s pop sensibility, while instrumentals “Horse” and “Rocket” set a more placid mood—that is, until the distorted, beat-driven “Brick” destroys any feelings of serenity exuded by the surrounding songs. Rocket ends with a rollicking free-for-all, “Guilty,” that in 
its numerous contributors and blaring saxophone synthesizes the album’s communal feel and restless sense of musical experimentation.In addition to its fluid network of musical styles, Rocket showcases Alex’s ability to project the perspectives of several characters while maintaining a strong personal voice. Whereas Beach Music’s lyrics outlined vague situations, with RocketAlex was “trying to create narratives that anybody could still inhabit,” he says, “but that had a more concrete quality.” He takes on the voice of memorable personalities such as what seems like an over-confident boy (“Powerful Man”), an alienated schoolgirl (“Alina”), and a couple with a creepily ambivalent relationship (“Bobby”). Their stories are at turns heartbreaking, puzzling, and hilarious; yet no matter the setting or the way he manipulates his voice, you always get an ineffable sense of “(Sandy) Alex G” as well as what he refers to as “an American perspective.”“Proud,” the album’s longest (and perhaps catchiest)track, depicts a guarded, potentially disingenuous conversation. “I’m so proud of you,” the narrator says. But later, their sincerity falls away: “I wanna be a fake like you...,” they add. “I just wanna play the game.” The chorus strikes an earnest note—that the person singing works not to play “the game” but to provide for their “baby.” Yet Alex makes sure that it’s never perfectly clear who’s talking, or who believes what, casting doubt over an otherwise personable, inviting song. Track eight, “Sportstar,”traces another uncertain—though, in this case, one-sided—dialogue. Here, the narrator is an obsessive fan of the titular “sportstar” who, with pitched-up vocals and atop a melancholic piano lead, recites stalker-like requests that range from benign (“Let me tie your Nikes”) to violently sexual (“Could you hit me too hard”). That the “sportstar” remains anonymous speaks to Rocket’s open-endedness. Even if the stories are grounded in specific ideas and real experiences, Alex paints pictures that leave room for listeners to share in the events—to interpret them however they’d like, without regard for a “right” answer.“I want [Rocket] to be completely unassuming,” Alex says. “I wanted it to be full of these characters that don’t know how crazy they are.” Rocket doesn’t have a pointed theme so much as these general feelings of unsteadiness and incomprehension—feelings we remember from growing up and that creep into the everyday life of adulthood as well. In some ways, the album’s title encapsulates this sense:“I like the word ‘rocket’because it sounds immature, attention-seeking,” Alex explains. But while rockets certainly make a big impression, they also burn out. On Rocket, the myopic characters teeter between the initial explosion and the ultimate burning out. Alex himself, though, in a collection of songs that’s both his tightest and most adventurous, is poised only for the ascent."
1,1846507,Nekromantix  - 30th Anniversary Tour,https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1846507?utm_medium=api,$18.00 - $20.00,2019-05-08 19:00:00,"Never self-serious while far from a joke at the same time, Nekromantix is a musical unearthing of the biggest themes from the greatest works of monster, zombie, vampire, werewolf and b-horror fiction; ripped from literature, comic book pages or classic celluloid. Nekromantix chases a darkly romantic muse with an even darker humor.

The Nekromantix catalog boasts enduring genre classics like the unapologetically hooky yet undeniably fierce “Who Killed the Cheerleader?” and “Gargoyles Over Copenhagen” alongside subversively sentimental cuts like “Haunted Cathouse” and “Subcultural Girl.” There are echoes of rock n’ roll’s greats and punk rock icons alike, all with modern flair.

A Symphony of Wolf Tones & Ghost Notes broadens the Nekromantix legacy with expansive ambition that never sacrifices the trio’s inherent grittiness, furiously stoking and reshaping the flames of the creative vision begun in Denmark with legendary labels like Nervous Records, through the band’s master classes in punk n’ roll albums stateside with Hellcat Records, the label cofounded by Tim Armstrong and Brett Gurewitz.

Armed with his signature coffin bass, chilling baritone, monstrous expressions and ten-stories-tall haircut, Kim Nekroman has earned tremendous respect, admiration and goodwill from a fiercely dedicated legion of hard-partiers, rabble-rousers, well-meaning degenerates, grease monkeys, outlaw bikers, nostalgic tastemakers and forward-thinking punks. It’s a crew of supporters as diverse as the otherwise classic and timeless music the Danish-born California transplant has unleashed as leader of Nekromantix.

Nekroman’s notorious quiff is as instantly recognizable as the coffin bass he’s slapped into submission on nine studio albums, countless worldwide tours and festivals. The quiff, of course, combines the midcentury rebel style of the pompadour and flattop with the punk attitude of New York and Europe from the late 70s. It’s a fitting symbol for the style of music Nekromantix has perfected into an art form, a rollicking psychobilly sound with reverence for the genre’s origins and predecessors, infused with an iconoclastic boundlessness that refuses to abandon the electric catharsis of unadulterated fun.

Return of the Loving Dead (2002) marked a career resurgence and subcultural breakthrough for what was previously a feverishly cherished underground band best known outside of North America, via now legendary records like Curse of the Coffin (1991), Brought Back to Life (1994), Demons Are a Girl’s Best Friend (1996) and their unstoppable debut, Hellbound (1989). The new millennium brought the band to America (at first to tour and eventually, to stay), conjuring into the world new Nekro landmarks in the forms of Dead Girls Don’t Cry (2004), Life is a Grave & I Dig It! (2007) and What Happens in Hell, Stays in Hell (2011), as Nekroman steered the band through shifting lineups and energized shows with bands like Rancid and Reverend Horton Heat.

Nekroman has been joined by skilled guitarist Francisco Mesa for nearly a decade now, with drummer Adam Guerrero bringing a fresh injection of passionate enthusiasm to the band in 2014. A Symphony of Wolf Tones & Ghost Notes is a fertile proving ground for a reenergized lineup that fans of the band have already loved for two years. New songs like “Glow in the Dark,” “War Bats” and “Resting Witch Face” are instant classics, standing mightily alongside the greatest Nekromantix songs enduring in their set list.

There are some bands whose sound, image and front person became synonymous with an entire subculture, whether as originators of a particular style, a crucial innovator among a handful of likeminded artists, or simply as the best embodiment of everything a specific style has to offer. Rock historians may debate who reigns supreme among Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, but there’s no denying they are all heavy metal titans. When someone says “Lemmy” or “Strummer” or “Blondie,” certain feelings are immediately invoked. There’s a palpable energy in the air among hardcore acolytes and culture mavens. It’s a kind of iconic resonance that transcends boundaries.

To their dedicated army of supporters around the world and across every dimension, Nekromantix stands tall among the ghosts in rock n’ roll’s undead cemetery."

U.S.A.!”   Not what one would expect to hear chanted vehemently from the members of an indie rock band in 2019... But Sego seems to get off on doing things one wouldn’t expect from an LA indie band today. Being proficientat their instruments instead of relying on computer tracks to play their new album Sego Suckslive, recording said album in a church in far away Canada in the winter, thus committing to the deliberate notion of an album more than an amalgamation of 'laptop studio' singles.  And yes, chanting “USA, USA, USA” as the main reprise of a reflective tune about entitlement culture.  One must ask why?  Why take it there?  Or one may not ask and instead bounce and bop their way through each energetic turn, just happy to have their blood pump a little faster than the “everything chill all the time” pace that we’ve all become accustomed to.And therein lies the trick of Sego. It’s a gosh-damn choose your own adventure story of music for adrenaline huffers and introspective socio-philosophical types alike.  Not that the two are mutually exclusive.I would say Sego hails from Utah, but when does anyone say that someone ‘hails’ from anywhere other than in gratuitous band bios, ya know? Sego is not only aware that their Utah upbringing is different from most Angeleno transplants, but they exhibit a sense of pride in the perspective it has given them.  Perhaps this is why singer Spencer Petersen finds ways to separate himself from the status quo. Like using a flip-phone still. And recording interludes with one of the many tape machines he has stock-piled in his studio. Sego Sucksis the cathartic result of a person like Spencer sorting his way through a natural resistance to being smothered by Modernism.  Sonically, the 10-track LP is woven with the changes of becoming a four piece band. Originally Spencer Petersen and Thomas Carroll, the band added members Alyssa Davey on bass and Brandon McBride on guitars and keys in 2018. The sound became more focused, but the raucous spirit that has kept people sweating since the beginning is just as tangible and, dare I say, primal as ever. The extensive touring they’ve done throughout North America, Europe, and the UK has also shown to be a strong influence. There’s heat, there’s resistance, there’s intelligence. Did Sego fool us and write a modern day punk album that could be played on the radio?To go to a Sego show is to be standing amongst very different people having very different experiences.  To your left is someone intently staring at Spencer digging through his many acid-tongued references trying to decipher his cryptic slant on absolutism.  Behind you is a gear-nut scratching their heads trying to understand what far corner of the brain one can write such dissonantly triumphant guitar parts.  In front of you is someone falling in love with Tom, Brandon or Alyssa depending on who the light falls upon in any given moment... or perhaps all 4 at the same time, the way it was always intended to happen when a band is really a band.  But perhaps most common is the person to your right, who is dripping in sweat, dancing with their eyes closed and losing themselves completely in an anoetic experience particular to when music is being played live.  And loud.

1,1837354,Midnight North,https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1837354?utm_medium=api,$12.00 - $15.00,2019-05-16 19:00:00,"In June of 2017,  Midnight North released their third studio album: Under the Lights. On this full length record, Midnight North left it all on the court. Recorded by David Simon-Baker (Los Lobos, ALO, Jackie Greene, Mother Hips) at the Greene Room and Allegiant Studios, Under the Lights features their 11 best new tunes. Expect flares of country on tracks like “The Highway Song” and “Greene County”, tinges of soul on the likes of “Back To California”, but mostly good solid rock and roll. With strong melodies and stronger harmonies, for this band it comes down to one thing: the song.

Immediately after their last studio release, 2015’s Scarlet Skies, Midnight North - fronted by lead songwriters Elliott Peck & Grahame Lesh with lush Hammond B3 organ, lead guitar, and harmony work from Alex Jordan and stomping bass lines from Connor O’Sullivan - began touring the country in earnest, visiting the East Coast and the Midwest for the first time in Summer 2015. The band wrote the majority of Under the Lightsin the following months, and the lyrical road themes - the initial excitement, the longing for home, and the inherent need to keep moving - shine through. 

“Under the Lights is the perfect title for this collection of songs,” said O’Sullivan. “These songs and lyrics are about being a band of musicians on the road away from home. Songs literally performed and tested under the lights at countless venues across the US.” 

Last year, while work in the studio continued, the band’s stream of amazing live shows and festival appearances sped by as the band jammed with heavyweights like Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Tom Hamilton, Mihali Savoulidis, and more. Hitting the road night after night and building their fan base has proved a lot of fun and every time they come back to a city the venues and crowds get bigger while the songs get tighter. “On the road you have an opportunity to dig into what the band is capable of and learn where your limits as a group are and aren’t,” said Jordan. “It was a wonderful opportunity to capture a sound on this album that is identifiably our own.”

In addition to all the touring, Midnight North is on year five of holding down Sunday nights at Terrapin Crossroads in San Rafael, CA. To celebrate the occasion, they released a free live album, Live at Terrapin Crossroads in 2016, where Relix Magazine took a shine to “the group’s powerful three-part harmonies.” Performing weekly for a hometown crowd allows a chance to continuously test new material. “I feel like I’ll come to the band with this raw idea and watch it totally come to life,” said Peck.

2017 continued the growth for Midnight North, as the exciting release of Under the Lights helped point the way for more and more fans to discover the band. “These songs tell our story, at least up to this point,” said Lesh. “Our job is to sing you these stories as honestly as we can and transport you into our world for an hour or two.”"
1,1824173,Henry Jamison,https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1824173?utm_medium=api,$15.00,2019-05-18 19:00:00,"In an era in which the magnitude of cultural sickness is coming to light, Henry Jamisonhas had some time to reflect. On his second record, Gloria Duplex, the Vermont songwriter deconstructs ideas of masculinity from boyhood to adulthood and what it meansto be a white, middle class male in America today. “All of the images that were coming to me were of boyhood or of manhood,” says Jamison. “It ended up that every song on the record is in some way addressing that subject.” It’s a lot to unpack.While an array of experiences fueled the themes behind Gloria Duplex, there were three in particular that made Jamison focus on the idea of coming-of-age.  As a boy, he wanted to be a baseball player. “I had some desire to fall into that quarterback-cheerleader summer romance and that never happened for me,” Jamison says. He course-corrected from that archetype and attended the small liberal arts school Bowdoin College, where he grappled with being an artist in a sea of would-be businessmen. “My acquaintance said he literally got a hard-on when he thought of Goldman Sachs,” Jamison recalls. Jamison found himself avoiding classes and enacting his own form of resistance as an autodidact. Lastly, gaining perspective from his girlfriend and his own maturation prompted him to hone in on the theme of masculinity. “On my first record there are two songs where I tried to paint myself as that ‘heart of gold bro,’”he says. “I was charging around in my world in my oblivious ways, and then I got schooled by my girlfriend,” who’s spoken voice he samples throughout the record as a semi-subconscious feminine perspective (more on that later). In his reading of the psychologist James Hillman, Jamison discovered the term gloria duplex, a Renaissance maxim for keeping a consciousness of both sides, or “healing the split.” If men in his position are guilty of too much certainty, an idea such as gloria duplex could bring complexity back into a discourse in which it is sorely needed. “It’s as if we’re standing in front of a beautiful rainbow and only seeing blue,” he says. “We need to see the whole ROYGBIV.”With Gloria Duplex, he takes on his own shortcomings as well as those of the men around him, and they often appear to really be the same thing. Jamison’s flair for baroque pop and complex storytelling shines, as he blends intricate acoustic guitar and banjo with cinematic percussion and synthesizers. His baritone, Nick Drake-like voice tells vivid tales of boyhood and manhood, painting scenes intimately in the fashion of Sufjan Stevens. There’s a vulnerability in Jamison’s voice as he recounts memories and stories with such emotional candor, it’s impossible to tell the difference between what’s real and what’s not. But Gloria Duplexis utterly affecting, portraying the raw realities of what it’s like to come of age.On the album’s first single “Gloria,” Jamison reworks a melody from Irish folk ballad “Arthur McBride,” a song that recalls military recruiters trying to get two boys to join the service. It’s significant to Jamison, though, that perhaps the main danger to boys when the original ballad was written was that they’d be recruited into the military; today the dangers may be ultimately similar, but arise in subtler form “There’s a slow process by which men and boys recruit eachother into this very reductive sense of what it is to be a person,” he says. On “Boys,” Jamison sings about initiation rites and confronts the idea that boys in our culture don’t know how to
become proper men. “The thing is that I feel that way too and I really don’t have the answer,” he says. “Ether Garden” is a delicate, string-plucked lullaby, full of  metaphor. And “American Babes” flaunts Jamison’s devastating talent for lyrical parole. But it’s the moments on the record where Jamison addresses the subject of masculinity with acute self-awareness that really stand out. “Was I looking up your skirt? Yeah of course I was,” a confessional and repentant Jamison sings on “True North” as casually as it happens to women every day on the subway. “Florence Nightingale” tackles his own misguided views of feminism that are a larger reflection of society. “I started going to acupuncture and this acupuncturist was this Florence Nightingale-like, very nurturing nurse character, and when I told my girlfriend that she thought it was terribly un-nuanced,” he says. “She asked why I couldn’t like strong, feminine power. So I corrected it to Mary Magdelene and included that correction in the song.” The song is Jamison’s self-proclaimed thesis statement, which chronicles his trying  to get it right but getting it wrong anyway. Recorded over a two-week period in New York City during January 2018, Gloria Duplex features an all-star cast including producer Thomas Bartlett (Sufjan Stevens, The National, Yoko Ono, St. Vincent, Florence & The Machine) string arranger Rob Moose (Bon Iver, Arcade Fire, Laura Marling, Perfume Genius, Phoebe Bridgers) and mixer Patrick Dillett (Rhye, David Byrne, Glen Hansard).Jamison’s 2017 debut album The Wildshas over 80 million streams and earned support from The Guardian, NPR, KCRW, Billboard, Echoes, Consequence of Sound, WXPN, World Cafe's Artist To Watch and more. He has also toured with artists including Big Thief, Darlingside, Lady Lamb, Caroline Rose and Haux.
With his stunning debut album, 'The Wilds,' Jamison is ready to claim his place as the latest in a long line of remarkable storytellers. Blending delicate acoustic guitar and banjo with programmed percussion loops and synthesizers, the Vermont songwriter grapples with the jarring dissonances of contemporary life in his music as he struggles to reconcile the clashes between our inner and outer selves, the natural world and our fabricated society. Jamison is a solitary artist, writing, recording, and arranging everything himself on the album including the string arrangements, and he pens his lyrics with cinematic precision, conjuring vivid scenes and fully realized characters wrestling with existential crises and modern malaise. His dazzling way with words and keen ear for memorable hooks at once calls to mind the baroque pop of Sufjan Stevens and the unflinching emotional honesty of Frightened Rabbit, but the delivery is uniquely his own, understated yet devastating. Jamison is a solitary artist who writes, records, and arranges everything himself, including all of the album's gorgeous string arrangements, and 'The Wilds' is a pure reflection of the world through his eyes.

Recorded on a mountainside in Goshen, VT, during breaks in the maple sugaring season, 'The Wilds' comes on the heels of Jamison's 2016 breakout debut EP, 'The Rains.' Tracks from that collection racked up more than 20 million streams on Spotify, as his uniquely off-kilter brand of lyricism earned a swarm of critical acclaim. NPR's World Café featured Jamison in their breaking artist series, raving that his ""descriptions of places ring true and his subtle production touches stand out,"" while Vice Noisey said his ""mellow folk...soothes your nerves,"" and Consequence of Sound praised him as a ""visual lyricist"" writing music that ""sounds like a dream taking form."" The EP earned Jamison dates with Big Thief, Lady Lamb, and Tall Heights plus festival appearances and performances across Europe."
1,1826652,Damien Jurado,https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1826652?utm_medium=api,$18.00 - $20.00,2019-05-23 19:00:00,"Spend any amount of time with Damien Jurado and he’s going to talk with you about movies. Speaking about the films that influenced his 14th album, the solitary masterwork In the Shape of a Storm, Jurado tosses out a list of favorites—American Graffiti, Paris, Texas, The Last Picture Show—films in which settings serve as silent, omniscient characters. But inquire about the curious way he writes songs, the hazy manner by which he seems to channel them from beyond the beyond, and the cinematic reference point he reaches for is a surprising one. “You ever see that movie Ghost? Whoopi Goldberg’s character, Oda Mae Brown—that’s who I am. These spirits are showing up at her door, jumping into her body. That’s how I feel. I don’t know what’s coming out of me…I just show up and deliver it.” 

For more than two decades, Jurado has sung folk songs brimming with prophetic imagination. Whether singing ballads about killers, wounded lovers, UFO cults, or yes, the phantoms of departed friends, he’s populated his work with eerie foretelling, the sense that he’s divining something just on the verge of happening. He wrote his last record, 2018’s The Horizon Just Laughed as a goodbye letter to his home of Seattle, Washington, before he’d even decided to leave there for sunny Los Angeles. And while he recorded the ten songs featured on In the Shape of a Storm months before the passing of his longtime collaborator and close friend Richard Swift, it’s no coincidence that Swift’s death looms over the album. “His absence is very much felt on this record,” Jurado says. 

Damien has always worked fast, but In the Shape of a Storm came together with unprecedented speed. Recorded over the course of two hours one California afternoon, it’s Jurado’s sparsest album to date. Gone are the thundering drums and psychedelic arrangements that defined the trilogy of concept albums he made with Swift. Gone even is the atmospheric air that hovered above his early albums for Sub Pop. Here, there’s only Jurado’s voice, acoustic guitar, and occasional accompaniment from Josh Gordon, playing a high-strung guitar tuned Nashville style, rendering its sound spooky and celestial. Though fans have long requested a solo acoustic album, the prospect never made sense to Jurado, until one day it simply did. “It just felt like it was time,” Jurado says. The idea of an unadorned album became its own medium in his mind, like a painter who sets down his brushes and instead opts for charcoal pencils instead. 

“There is nothing left to hide,” Jurado sings on “Lincoln,” which opens the record. It’s something of a thesis statement for these songs. Everything here is clear and laid bare, two-tone, like the drawing Jurado crafted for the record’s cover. Originally written for 2000’s The Ghost of David, “Lincoln” was shelved and forgotten about until Damien came across it on an old cassette tape. The discovery inspired him to go about gathering up songs that had never found proper homes. As a result, In the Shape of a Storm is like an archive of previously abandoned songs. And yet, despite their disparate nature, Jurado’s visions hang together in curiously symmetrical ways: the moon shines in both the echo-drenched “Silver Ball” and closer “Hands on the Table”; rain ties the title song to the lilting “Oh Weather.” Jurado repeatedly returns to oceanic poetry—waves, tides, and shores—and to the theme of anchors, the metaphorical ones we use to tether ourselves to the sea floor and to each other. These are songs about the enormity of the unknown — the shape of storms that threaten to swallow us whole— and above all, they are songs about the connections that keep us from drifting away. “We are not meant to be on our own,” Jurado sings on “Throw Me Now Your Arms.” 

Damien Jurado’s discography is filled with songs written as miniature movies, cinematic vignettes that capture people, the places they are from, and where they are going. In the Shape of a Storm is his first black and white picture. It’s both a snapshot of two hours in a California recording studio and a document spanning 19 years and a life of music. It is the sound of a singer pouring out possible futures and visions. “I believe songs have their own time and place,” Jurado says. For these ten, that time has finally come."
1,1835461,Amy Ray Band,https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1835461?utm_medium=api,$25.00 - $30.00,2019-06-01 19:00:00,"A lot of artists defy categorization. Some do so because they are tirelessly searching for the place they fit, while others are constantly chasing trends. Some, though, are genuinely exploring and expressing their myriad influences. Amy Ray belongs in the latter group. Pulling from every direction — Patty Griffin to Patti Smith, Big Star to Bon Iver — Ray's music might best be described as folk-rock, though even that would be a tough sell, depending on the song.

Ray's musical beginnings trace back to her high school days in Atlanta, Georgia, when she and Emily Saliers formed the duo that would become the Indigo Girls. Their story started in 1981 with a basement tape called “Tuesday's Children” and went on to include a deal with Epic Records in 1988, a Grammy in 1990, and nearly 20 albums over more than 30 years.

Rooted in shared passions for harmony and justice, the Indigo Girls have forged a career that combines artistry and activism to push against every boundary and box anyone tries to put them in. As activists, they have supported as many great causes as they can, from LGBTQ+ rights to voter registration, going so far as to co-found an environmental justice organization, Honor the Earth, with Winona LaDuke in 1993. As artists, they have dipped their toes into a similar multitude of waters — folk, rock, country, pop, and more — but the resulting releases are always pure Indigo.

Ray's six solo sets — and three live albums — have charted even wider seas, from the political punk of 2001's Stag to the feminist Americana of 2018's Holler. Each effort seems to lean into her influences in different ways, whether it's the Allman Brothers or the Carter Family. One album finds the Butchies on full blast, another features Alison Brown on bluegrass banjo. 

Both Stag and its follow-up, Prom (2005), found Ray addressing societal woes, ranging from the dangers of homophobia to the machismo of rock & roll, all while channeling her inner Replacements into a Southern punk sound that she has called ""subversiveness with a smile."" Ray softened her sonic stance a bit for her next two efforts, 2008's Didn't It Feel Kinder and 2012's Lung of Love, both of which felt closer in tone to her work with Indigo Girls, confronting cultural issues alongside personal ones.

In retrospect, it's easy to see how songs like Lung of Love's “Bird in the Hand” and “The Rock Is My Foundation” served as signposts of what was to come next for Ray. With Goodnight Tender in 2014, she recorded in Asheville, North Carolina, and stepped squarely into the country music that has been a part of everything she's done. But it's not the kind of country heard on the radio; it's the country music culled from folk, bluegrass, gospel, and Southern rock, going so far as to title a tune after Duane Allman.

For 2018's Holler, Ray recorded, once again, with her Carolina country kin, adding horns and strings to all but split the musical distance between Kinder and Tender to create a soulful, country-tinged, gospel-infused Americana sound. More cohesively than her prior releases, Holler encompasses and imparts all the disparate aspects of Ray's influences in a singular offering.

Ray's vast artistic inspirations are matched only by the deep peer admiration that is reflected in her albums' guest appearances, which have included Vince Gill, Brandi Carlile, Justin Vernon, Jim James, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Phil Cook, and others. That kind of good will is something only built from a lifetime of good deeds and great music.

While she partnered with Compass Records to issue Holler, Ray's home base is Daemon Records, the not-for-profit label she founded in 1990 to support grassroots artists, including Kristen Hall, Rose Polenzani, Girlyman, John Trudell, Gerard McHugh, the Rock-A-Teens, and others. With Daemon, as with everything, Ray aimed to give something back to the community from which she has gotten so much.

Solo or duo, with a band or an orchestra, together and apart, both Ray and Saliers pour themselves into every performance, and their audiences still soak up every ounce of that generosity, spilling their own hearts and souls out as they sing along to every song. Theirs isn't a fanbase; it's a family."

""If the idea of an African Nick Drake or Cat Stevens appeals, then Daby Touré is your man."" - The Times (UK)

With his wide-ranging voice, virtuosic guitar work, and knack for songwriting, Daby is a force to be reckoned with.” – Songlines Magazine

Born in Mauritania, and raised in Senegal, Daby Touré lived for more than a quarter century in Paris before moving recently to Montreal. While his father and uncles formed the pioneering Afropop band Toure Kunda, Touré has always followed his own musical path, with influences ranging from African folk melodies and desert blues, to jazz, pop, reggae, funk and soul. Blessed with an open mind and an explorer's spirit, Touré's catchy songs are as likely to appeal to fans of African stars Habib Koité and Youssou N'Dour as they are to followers of Bob Marley, Paul Simon and Stevie Wonder.

Touré has shared the stage and studio with everyone from pop superstar Peter Gabriel, Algerian singer-songwriter Souad Massi, Italian folk adventurer Enzo Avitabile, African-American bluesman Skip McDonald, French pop icon Maxime LeForestier and Israeli-African collaborative The Touré-Raichel Collective.

Whether he appears solo or with his full four-piece band, Daby Touré never fails to astound audiences with his ethereal voice, masterful guitar work and catchy original songs. He illuminates the darkest of concert halls with his joyful performances and infectious love of music.

Daby spent his childhood in Mauritania, a country in western Africa. As a boy in Mauritania he was an avid listener to the radio and was influenced by The Police, Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson. He taught himself the basics of guitar and from an early age felt instinctively that his destiny was to become a musician.

Daby moved to Paris when he was a teenager. His passion for music gradually drew him from his business studies and he started playing in the Parisian music scene. He founded the duo Touré-Touré with his cousin Omar, and released a wellreceived album Laddé in 2000 that led to touring across Europe and the United States.

After many years of solo experimentation, playing and recording Daby met with electro musician and producer Cyrille Dufay in 2003. This meeting was to prove pivotal and led to the making of Daby's first solo album Diam, which convinced Peter Gabriel to sign him to his British record label Real World Records in 2004. Before long, Daby was opening for Peter
Gabriel on his ""Growing Up"" world tour.

Diam received praise from media worldwide. Billboard raved, ""Touré's music evokes modern and traditional modes of life: It's as influenced by the sounds coming out of today's Senegal, Mali, Paris and New York as it is favored by the traditional music of his native Mauritania. Touré is a rising star."" Liberation called it ""One of the best albums of the year,"" and Glamour
warned, ""Watch out, this record might make you happy."" In 2006, Daby Touré was nominated for the BBC World Music Awards in the category ""Discovery of the Year”.

He continued working with Peter Gabriel’s Real World label on his second album, which included some impressive collaborations. Ben Finlay, a recording & mixing engineer who had previously worked with Peter Gabriel, Sting, Simply Red, Jeff Beck and Robert Plant was part of the process, as was Tom Oliver, an engineer whose has worked with Sinead O’ Connor, U2, Seun Kuti, Tony Allen and Charlie Winston.

In 2007, Daby released Stereo Spirit on Real World Records, and continued to earn praise from international media. Songlines wrote that the album, ""showcases Touré 's impossibly beautiful wide-ranging voice to perfection. Stereo Spirit is packed with catchy hooks and lyrics that seem to demand a singalong, no matter what language they are delivered in. A barrier-leaping album from a rising star.""

2009 saw Daby heading in a different musical direction, teaming up with African-American bluesman Skip McDonald for the EP Call My Name. The US magazine Sing Out! described the EP as ""neither African music nor blues, but instead something that pulls from both and also from rock, a touch of pop and even dub for a unique, appealing and - it has to be said - quite commercial sound. The two voices and styles complement each other perfectly, and the songs they've created - for they seem more like creations than compositions - summon up echoes of their histories, but end up in a hybrid that's essentially completely new."" The EP was widely praised; the British newspaper The Guardian gave it five stars.

After leaving Real World, Daby signed to Universal Music. His 2012 release Lang (u) age saw Daby singing largely in French and led to collaborations with French pop icons Francis Cabrel and Maxime Le Forestier.

Daby has been invited to perform across the globe, including the Grand Prix Formula 1 in Singapore alongside Bob Geldof and Rihanna; the launch of the America’s Cup in Italy with Enzo Avitabile; and as a supporting act for Peter Gabriel’s “Back To Front” world tour.

After releasing three albums with the Peter Gabriel's Real World label and one with Universal Music, Touré revived his independent spirit with Amonafi, an album released in 2015 on respected international music label Cumbancha. Amonafi alternates between bittersweet songs and more playful ones, moving from folk and soul to upbeat Afropop. In Amonafi listeners can sense an identity in transit, one moving away from clichés. It's a fitting image for the soundtrack, a series of little stories which viewed from a distance, paint an image of a creative mind that is always in action.

""I was born in Africa"" states Daby. ""And all the traditional music I picked up when I was young is still in me and that doesn't change. But in my music I am still searching, and mixing, and trying things and that's what I am doing now. I have travelled far from the 'traditional' or 'folkloric' music of my country."""

With seven distinct personalities, Juice distills rock, r&b and hip-hop into a signature sound with
a distinct kick of electric violin, rich harmonies, honest lyrics, and festival-worthy choruses. The Boston septet—Ben Stevens [lead vocals], Michael Ricciardulli [guitar], Rami El-Abidin [bass], Christian Rose [violin, vocals], Kamau Burton [acoustic guitar, vocals], Daniel Moss [guitar], and Miles Clyatt [drums]—perfects this mix on its 2018 independent project.
 
“There are so many colors when we play,” explains Michael. “The chemistry is there in the studio and on stage. When we play to a crowd, it’s all organic. The reactions... the faces... the experience, what you see is what you’re getting, people know that, they can tell. We’ve learned to listen to each other and to what the music has to say. At the same time, we channel our youth, there’s no bottling that up. We’re always searching for something tangible our listeners can thoroughly feel at the core of the music. We’re trying to create an atmosphere much bigger than the seven of us on stage.”

It was evident from the band’s beginnings that this collective potency could contribute to something far greater, and something truly different.  After meeting as freshman at Boston College, Juice became unified upon winning their school’s “Battle of the Bands” in 2014. Soon after, things got serious.

Through constant gigging Juice honed their live performance, displaying an original raw energy. Soon, Juice went from frequent gigs at the city’s famed Middle East to selling out East Coast hotspots such as Brighton Music Hall, Mercury Lounge, Rockwood Music Hall, and more. Releasing their full-length debut in 2016, the band landed a viral hit in the form of “Gold,” which popped up on countless “Discover Weekly” playlists and cracked over 386,000 Spotify streams without any traditional promotion.

Hitting Summerfest Milwaukee for the first time in 2016, Juice impressively won the grand prize at of the festival’s “Land The Big Gig” Competition. Graduating from college a year later, the musicians returned to the annual festival and opened for pop juggernaut DNCE.
 
Along the way, they carefully sharpened their style, merging virtuosic musicianship and vivid songwriting. “The hardest question for us to answer is always who do we sound like. We have so many influences from so many different places. When it all falls together, we end up with songs that are honest, songs that we love, songs people remember...but songs that don’t sound like anyone else” explains Michael.
 
“It’s a combination of so many things,” says Rami. “Everyone hears their own impression, first you might hear the violin, then the soulful, dynamic vocals, and then the melody driven guitars, all of which is anchored by our prominent rhythm section.”

After meeting GRAMMY® Award-nominated producer Johnny K at Summerfest, the band headed to Milwaukee in 2017 to record their upcoming project. Now, they introduce this collection with the soaring single “Sugar.” Hummable funk guitars lay over a steady groove before the chantable hook—“I cannot get by without you honey”—takes hold. Airtight raps and radiant chorus harmonies drive the song into the bridge before an old school rock n’ roll guitar solo gives way to stomping handclaps and gospel-style backing vocals.
 
“On the surface, you can think of ‘Sugar’ traditionally like buying into lust, it’s an insatiable feeling” explains Michael. “It does go a little deeper though. At our age, we experience elements of this vanity culture in high concentration. It speaks to that. There are also elements of temptation in there, but at its core, it’s some youths taking a crack at a bright rock ‘n’ roll record.”

Clean guitars unfurl amidst flourishing violin and delicate crooning on the heartfelt “Workin’ On Lovin’,” which culminates on the admission, “I need someone to love.” Dreamy piano shuffles into a young love confessional on “September Told Me.”
 
Then, there’s “Heartbreak In A Box.” An honest statement about “holding onto feelings after they’ve left your life.” Michael adds, “Sometimes sorrow and pain are the medium in which we recall feelings of joy.”
 
“It’s a good feeling to give listeners something honest, it teaches you a lot.” Michael leaves off. “You hope someone gives your music a chance, you hope that they might feel something you once felt and make it their own, have their own sensations. We work hard to deliver that”.

Bim’s infectious Boston Blue Beat sound led them to be one of the premier bands kick-starting the Third Wave of Ska in the 1980s. Other bands quickly followed their example resulting in a lively scene in Boston and much of the United States.

1,1833091,Built to Spill - Keep It Like A Secret Tour,https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/1833091?utm_medium=api,$27.00 - $30.00,2019-09-16 19:00:00,"When Built To Spill wanted to find out what their music sounded like they locked themselves in Doug Martschs garage. Without a tentative conclusion or even a hypothesis the four members began to experiment. Their collaborative efforts lasted seasons and yielded dozens of hours of ADAT tape. The album You In Reverse documents the newest branch of Built To Spills chaotic, yet elegant evolution.

Doug Martsch formed Built To Spill in 1992. His intention was to sustain a project that would involve a rotating cast of musicians to record albums and tour. The first incarnation of Built To Spill included Doug, Brett Netson, and Ralf (Youtz). Recording in the middle of the night in order to get free studio time, they assembled 1993s Ultimate Alternative Wavers. For a few years and a few records band members came and went. In 1996, while recording the album Perfect From Now On (their Warner Bros. Records debut), Doug found a rhythm section he could not relinquish: Brett Nelson and Scott Plouf. This line-up toured and made records with additional guest musicians Brett Netson and Sam Coomes. In 1999, after the release of Keep It Like A Secret, Jim Roth joined the band as live co-guitarist.

In the five years since the bands most recent effort Ancient Melodies Of The Future was released, Built To Spill took an eighteen-month vacation. When the group returned to work, the line-up included Jim Roth as a core member. This foursome started jamming and recording their hours-long musical explorations. According to Doug, they had no idea what kind of music they wanted to make.

You In Reverse arrives as the most collaborative record in the bands thirteen-year history. To a large extent, each musician wrote his own parts. Half of the finished material incorporates segments the band wrote together during jam sessions.

Doug did bring in a few songs ready to go. Tracks like Liar and Saturday were pretty much there when the band learned them, while Goin Against Your Mind and Traces are full of riffs discovered during musical research. Dougs private writing process then allowed him to meld favorite spontaneous moments with composed transitions and intricate melodies.

With a batch of songs in hand, the goal became to keep the recording simple and stripped down. The band wanted to retain the impromptu, organic feel of their jams. Rather than Dougs former reliance on extensive overdubs, the group tried to capture loose and live moments, letting each individual musicians talents be more accurately represented. Instead of a broad, atmospheric sweep, this record sounds natural. It resonates with relationships, the way the band as a whole responds to music and to each other. Being the new guy, Jim Roth appreciated this approach. To Jim, they were striving to see what the band could be, the four of us. Now we can see the potential. These new songs are just starting to scratch the surface. Expressing his connection to music as that of both craftsman and artist, he considers each composition to be like a painting or a sculpture, its own thing.

As a discrete creation the record relies on more than good chemistry and Dougs expansive writing. The band decided to self-produce in order to put themselves in a new situation. Similar to the generative process, they felt a need to try something different. Just to see what would happen, Doug admits, Ive made enough records to know I could do this. Also, engineers take pride in their work and would not let it be too fucked up. When they chose Steve Lobdells Audible Alchemy studio, they happened upon another element of the album. Steve, being the musical person he is, just fell into the role of co-producer, Doug says, then recants, Its not even really produced. Its cleanly recorded and mixed. Its not slick.

At Audible Alchemy, they wound up chasing a 1960s sound. Sonically, Doug says, We wanted it to sound like classic rock or soula piece of vinyl. Both Steve and engineer Jacob Hall are audiophiles who love old records and are into those sorts of sounds. They used analog recording equipment and spent hours listening back to tracks for the smallest nuances. Steve (a member of Faust) also played space echo, guitar, vibes, and percussion on the record. He understood the songs and their parameters, making specific and well-considered contributions.

Other guest musicians include Quasis Sam Coomes on organ and longtime Built To Spill contributor Brett Netson on guitar. Partway through the making of this record, Netson officially joined Built To Spill as their fifth member and played guitar on three of the songs. His mind-melting solo on Just A Habit will remind longtime Built To Spill listeners of the amazing lead guitar tracks he laid down for Perfect From Now On.

When Doug is asked what he wants people to know about the album, he replies, I would rather not manipulate peoples opinions about it. Bassist Brett Nelson thinks this record is what everybody in the band would want it to sound like. Brett also mentions the different styles of songs, anything from New Wave to Reggae breakdowns. While many influences and song structures arise and dissolve, none dominates the overall force of the album.

The songs are haunting rather than catchy. Each musical thought is surprising and complete. Dougs lyrics hint at politics, but could also be personal. As usual, the words lining the songs are neither directive nor dogmatic. Rational thoughts are constantly sacrificed to the metric and melodic needs of each song. No message blares forth. And yet, its understood."

The current lineup (Dave Hartman - drums; Mary Huff - bass and vocals; Rick Miller - guitar and vocals) has been playing together for over 30 years. The band's musical journey has taken them from all-night NC house parties to late night network talk shows, and from performing at the base of Mt. Fuji in Japan to rockin' out for the inmates at NC Correctional Facilities. Their music has been featured in movies and TV, and used to sell everything from diamonds to pork sausage, and their legendary live shows are a testament to the therapeutic powers of foot-stomping, butt-shaking rock and roll.

Bootleggers Choice is the brand new album from Southern Culture On The Skids. The album features 16 all-new recordings of the most requested songs from the bands long out-of-print major label releases, Dirt Track Date (1995) and Plastic Seat Sweat (1997), plus a re-mastered edition of the original 1991 recording of ""Camel Walk"" from the Santo Sings EP. These 16 new recordings were tracked and mixed by Rick Miller and the original engineer/producer of Dirt Track Date and Plastic Seat Sweat, the one and only Mark Williams, at Ricks rural NC studio (and SCOTS clubhouse) The Kudzu Ranch.

The band made seven studio albums before disbanding in 2005. After a ten-year break, they reunited and toured in 2015, and in 2017 released a new LP — A Sentimental Education and an EP of instrumentals — A Place of Greater Safety.

Other recent reissues include a deluxe 2xLP version of their classic Penthouse album (on Rhino) and another 2xLP set Lunafied that collects all the covers the band record-ed in the 1990s.

Now scattered around the country (Los Angeles, New York and Austin) the band re-tains the same lineup that operated from 1999 to 2005: Dean Wareham on vo-cals/guitar, his wife Britta Phillips on bass, Sean Eden on guitar, and Lee Wall on drums.

A Luna Timeline:

1992. Dean Wareham recruits Justin Harwood (ex-Chills) on bass and Stanley Demeski (ex-Feelies) on drums to record Lunapark for Elektra Records.
