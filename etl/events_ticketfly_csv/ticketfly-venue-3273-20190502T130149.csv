Fans are invited to celebrate the 42nd  anniversary of this concert as The State Theatre of Ithaca presents a FREE screening of  “The Grateful Dead Movie” on Wednesday, May 8th 2019 at 8:00 PM.  

Jerry Garcia directs this concert film of highlights from the five-night run at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom that capped off the Grateful Dead's 1974 tour. The film is distinguished among concert films for its unusual focus on the band's fans and their often extreme commitment to the Deadhead lifestyle. The documentary also features interviews with band members, including Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir and Phil Lesh, and includes a short but lively recap of the group's history.

The Grateful Dead played more than 2,000 concerts, but none continue to spark interest and provoke discussion quite like the band’s performance at Cornell University’s Barton Hall on May 8, 1977.  The show, known by most Deadheads as simply “5/8/77” is one of the most collected, circulated and debated concerts by any band ever, has topped numerous fan polls through the years, and was a favorite of the group’s longtime archivist Dick Latvala, who stated: “Enough can’t be said about this superb show.” Even Uncle Sam got into the act in 2011 when the recording was “deemed so important to the history and culture of the United States” that a copy was added to the Library of Congress’ National Recording Registry.

Admission is FREE for the screening of “The Grateful Dead Movie” at The State Theatre of Ithaca on Wednesday May 8, 2019.  This event is generously sponsored by Viva Taqueria, Pasta Vitto, The Tompkins County Chamber of Commerce’s Movies in the Park Series and Cayuga Radio Group I-100 Classic Rock."

Ronald Reagan was President when the Steps began, so co-founders Elaina Newport, Bill Strauss and Jim Aidala figured that if entertainers could become politicians, then politicians could become entertainers! Their first idea was to stage a nativity play, but in the whole Congress they couldn't find three wise men or a virgin! So, they decided to dig into the headlines of the day, and created song parodies & skits which conveyed a special brand of satirical humor that was as popular in Peoria as it was on Pennsylvania Avenue."

An avid scuba diver and photographer, Gates has participated in sub-sea archaeological excavations in the Mediterranean, and his wanderlust has taken him to over 100 countries - from sweltering African deserts to the icy shores of Antarctica. In addition, he has scaled “the roof of Africa” on Mt. Kilimanjaro and climbed Aconcagua, the tallest mountain in the Americas. A mysterious “Yeti” footprint recovered by Josh in the Himalayas is now on display at the “Expedition Everest” attraction at Walt Disney’s Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida.

In 2016, Gates won ‘Best Host’ in the CableFax Program Awards for Expedition Unknown, and the series also took home the ‘Best Educational/Instructional Show’ award and in 2018, a Cynopsis TV Award for ‘Best Reality Series – Travel.’ He holds a degree from Tufts University in Archaeology and is a member of The Explorers Club – a prestigious organization dedicated to the advancement of exploration and field research.
